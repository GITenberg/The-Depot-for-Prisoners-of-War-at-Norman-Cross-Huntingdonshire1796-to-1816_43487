ix</span>FOREWORDS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> April 1894 an exhibition was
held at the Grand Assembly Rooms, Peterborough, under the
auspices of the Local Natural History and Antiquarian Society,
the major portion of the exhibits being articles of various
descriptions made by the French prisoners of war at the barracks
built in 1796&ndash;97 for their confinement at Norman
Cross.&nbsp; On that occasion, Dr. Walker drew up a short account
of the buildings and their inmates, derived principally from
recollections of old people and from old newspaper files.&nbsp;
Now that most of the relics then exhibited, and many others
collected from various quarters, have found a permanent home in
the Society&rsquo;s Museum, it has been thought that the lecture
embodying that history, which exists to-day only as a newspaper
report, should be expanded and reproduced in the more accessible
and permanent form of a small volume.</p>
<p>The lecture was incomplete, and to produce an exhaustive
history it has been necessary to carry out systematic researches
in the British Museum Library, in the Public Record Office, and
in other repositories of information.</p>
<p>The general reader of a book is not concerned with the method
of its construction, the complete structure is the only thing
regarded, yet a very amusing digression could be given describing
the difficulties attending the search, especially in the
Government stores, for the <a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>material which is incorporated in this
volume.&nbsp; Many of the documents utilised had never been
looked at since they were placed in sacks at the close of the
war, when Red Tape was more rampant than to-day, and when the
jurisdictions of several departments overlapped, causing
obstructive friction and consequent confusion.&nbsp; The official
calendars and indices afford little or no indication as to the
nature of the contents of bundles and rolls; in several cases
valuable information has been obtained from bundles giving no
hint of the contents, and simply marked &ldquo;Various&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Miscellaneous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the cumbersome and complicated system in vogue in the
various offices at the close of the eighteenth century, the very
limited staff employed could not keep pace with the pressure of
the war.&nbsp; At Woolwich, Sir William Congreve reported that in
some branches of his department the accounts were three and four
years in arrears, in one branch as many as seven years, and
pleaded for an extra clerk, which request, after some
correspondence, was granted.&nbsp; This pressure led to laxity of
supervision, culminating in corruption even in high places, and
at last in 1804 General De Lancey, the Barrack Master-General,
the head of the department responsible for the buildings at
Norman Cross and other depots, was dismissed for defalcations,
and the report of a Commission appointed to investigate his
accounts from 1792 to that date, affirms that he had &ldquo;made
the most extravagant bargains both for land and buildings, and
actually entrusted the contract for the fittings of barracks to a
single individual, upon the easiest and most insecure of
agreements. . . .&nbsp; The Commissioners of Audit were ignored,
and the authority of the Treasury set aside on the most
ridiculous pretexts; and when inquiry was at last made in 1804,
it was found that over nine million pounds of public money had
been issued to the Barrack Master-General&rsquo;s <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>department,
and that no accurate account could be produced either of the
public or private expenditure of the same.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a>&nbsp; This Report led to an inquiry by
an eminent firm of accountants as to the method of keeping the
accounts, and the following extract from their long and detailed
report may be of interest, as showing the confused nature of the
materials through which we have had to search for facts throwing
light on our subject:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Variety, extent and importance of the
Business conducted by the Barrack Department, seems to require
perhaps more than any other, that all the Accounts should be
entered in the Books in such order, and with such precision as
that a true Statement of the whole, or of any particular branch
of the business may be produced whenever required without
constant recurrence to the Vouchers and papers from which these
Books are formed.&nbsp; This cannot be effected in any way so
well as by regular Books kept in a manner that has been in use
for many hundred years, is familiar to Men of Business in all
Countries, is equally applicable to the finances of a Kingdom as
to the Accounts of a private family, and upon which the best
Accomptants have not been able to make much improvement: but in
the Barrack Office, so far from adopting this method, they have
no Waste Book or Day Book, nor have they any Journal which is the
most essential of all Books, where there is a number of Entries
to make, and without which they cannot record any transfer of
property, nor any transaction whatever which does not come
through the Cash Book.&nbsp; Their Ledgers are posted chiefly
from Vouchers and accounts, and resemble more what is commonly
called a Check Ledger, than one which has a regular reference to
a Journal and Cash Book, from which only every Entry in the <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>Ledger
should be made.&nbsp; Their Ledgers can never be regularly
balanced, nor can an error that may be made, by placing a sum of
money to a wrong account, be easily detected&mdash;indeed no
Examination of any Account in the Ledger can be made without
referring to the Vouchers.&nbsp; Much time and labour is often
uselessly spent in searching for them, and replacing
them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This report led to an immediate reform, and research through
the documents bearing dates later than 1806 was far easier than
that through those of the previous decade, at the commencement of
which the Norman Cross Prison came into existence.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that the documents of the various
Government departments now concentrated in the Public Record
Office are numbered by millions, and of those relating to
Prisoners of War there are over 700 volumes, besides hundreds of
rolls, bundles, and packets, pertaining to the Admiralty and War
Office departments; these include various branches now completely
transformed, such as Transport Board, Commission for Sick and
Hurt, etc.&nbsp; Huge Ledgers are not indexed, nor are the
accounts entered consecutively.&nbsp; Rough minute books and
letter books on all conceivable subjects are in the same chaotic
condition, so that whole days have been wasted on a fruitless
search, while on the other hand important results have been
unexpectedly obtained in unlikely and unlooked-for quarters.</p>
<p>It may pardonably be allowed to refer to what little has been
done by others in the same direction, both with regard to
barracks and to prisons.&nbsp; A comparison with the following
pages will show that earlier researches have been of a very
superficial character.&nbsp; Matters have been left doubtful
which a little further search would have made certain, and
points, which tradition and writers with some claim to authority
had left obscure, would have been cleared up.&nbsp; It would be
invidious to go into further particulars, but it may be <a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>stated
that Huntingdon, in which county Norman Cross is situated,
although it has an important and eventful history, has as yet no
exhaustive County History, and that the local guide books are of
little value.</p>
<p>The results of these researches through official documents,
through old newspaper files, and topographical works, in the
British Museum Library, are, in the following pages, incorporated
with information obtained locally from persons who in their early
youth knew the prison, from topical traditions, from printed
narratives founded more or less on fact, from parish registers,
and from old private letters and diaries.</p>
<p>To the officials at the British Museum and the Record Office
our thanks are due for valuable assistance courteously
rendered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for the completeness of this narrative, no
record of the life at the Depot, written by a Norman Cross
prisoner or by any official, is known to exist.&nbsp; Such
sources of information exist in the case of at least one of the
other prisons, and to fill a blank, which must have been left in
this history, we are, by the kind permission of the author, Mr.
Basil Thomson, enabled to include in this volume a reprint of

eventful twenty-two years, 1793&ndash;1815, when the pens of
those recording the contemporary history of their country were
occupied with the deeds of the British Army and Navy beyond her
shores to the exclusion of the minor details of her social and

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Depot for Prisoners of War, at
Norman Cross in Huntingdonshire, was the first, and during twelve
years the only prison specially constructed for the custody of
the prisoners taken captive in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic
Wars between 1793 and 1815.&nbsp; The Norman Cross Depot received
its first inmates on the 7th April 1797; while of the other great
prisons built for the same purpose, Dartmoor (since 1850 the
Convict Prison) was not occupied until 24th May 1809, and Perth
(converted into the general Prison for Scotland in <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>1839) received
its first batch of 399 prisoners on the 6th August 1812.</p>
<p>Eight years before the building of the Norman Cross Prison the
French Revolution had commenced.&nbsp; The storming of the
Bastille had taken place in 1789, and during the following years
events had advanced rapidly.&nbsp; In 1792, Louis XVI, yielding
to the demands of the assembly, the Girondists, and the populace
of Paris, had declared war against Austria.&nbsp; In 1793 the
Republican Government had been established, Louis had been
deposed and executed, and on the 1st February of the same year
France had declared war against Britain, thus commencing that
struggle which lasted, with two short intermissions, to the final
overthrow of Buonaparte at Waterloo on the 18th June 1815.</p>
<p>This war&mdash;of which the historian Alison, writing in the
first half of the last century, said, &ldquo;It was the longest,
most costly and bloodiest war mentioned in
history&rdquo;&mdash;cost England above two thousand millions of
money, a colossal sum, which represented a proportionate number
of lives sacrificed, and a proportionate amount of misery and
want, not only to the combatants on both sides, but to the great
mass of the civil population of every nation drawn into the
conflict.</p>
<p>In recent years there have been wars of shorter duration, more
costly and more deadly, but none in which so fierce a spirit of
animosity reigned in the breasts of the combatants, none in which
the miseries of war were dragged out to the same calamitous
length.</p>
<p>The history of the prison at Norman Cross brings forcibly
before us those prolonged miseries incidental to war, which are
liable to be overlooked by such students as contemplate only</p>
<blockquote><p>The neighing steed and the shrill trump,<br />
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,<br />
The royal banner, and all quality,<br />
Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>The poet
paints the close of a hard-fought day when</p>
<blockquote><p>Thousands had sunk on the ground overpowered,<br
/>
The weary to sleep and the wounded to die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The matter-of-fact chronicler records the exact number of
killed, wounded, and missing, and of guns, standards, and
prisoners captured on either side; but the after-history of those
prisoners is left unwritten, their sufferings are
unrevealed!&nbsp; And yet, between 1793 and 1815, literally
hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war were held in captivity
by the various nations engaged in the conflict, and this
confinement meant for the great bulk of them years of misery,
long vistas of monotonous restraint, periods of indifferent
treatment, occasionally great physical suffering, and, worse than
all, for many, moral deterioration and degradation inseparable
from the conditions in which they dragged out their
existence.&nbsp; However humane the captors might be, these
consequences to the unfortunate captives were inevitable during
the protracted Napoleonic Wars of the close of the eighteenth and
commencement of the nineteenth centuries; and there is only too
much evidence that when matters on which not only the comforts,
but the actual lives of the prisoners depended, were being
debated by the two hostile Governments, the political and
military interests of the nations concerned were regarded before
those of the wretched captives.</p>
<p>The great Napoleon revolutionised the art of warfare, as the
great Gustavus revolutionised the military organisations of
Europe, and one result of this revolution was that the chivalrous
treatment of prisoners of war and non-combatants, which prevailed
up to Napoleon&rsquo;s accession to power, was materially
changed.&nbsp; A great French authority on International Law,
writing in 1758, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As soon as your enemy has laid down his
arms <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and
surrendered his body, you have no longer any right over his
life.&nbsp; Prisoners may be secured, and for this purpose may be
put into confinement, and even fettered, if there be reason to
apprehend that they will rise on their captors, or make their
escape.&nbsp; But they are not to be treated harshly, unless
personally guilty of some crime against him who has them in his
power. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;We extol the English and French, we feel our bosoms
glow with love for them, when we hear accounts of the treatment
which prisoners of war, on both sides, have experienced from
those generous nations.&nbsp; And what is more, by a custom which
equally displays the honour and humanity of the Europeans, an
officer, taken prisoner-of-war, is released on his parole, and
enjoys the comfort of passing the time of his captivity in his
own country, in the midst of his family; and the party who have
thus released him rest as perfectly sure of him as if they had
him confined in irons.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abundant testimony can be adduced to the truth of what Vattel
asserts from contemporary records as to both nations. <a
name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a>&nbsp; But between 1758 and 1773, the
dates of the first and second editions of the French work just
quoted, there was born, in Ajaccio in Corsica, a man who was to
change all this&mdash;Napoleon Buonaparte, who, contemporaneously
with the building of Norman Cross Prison, was erecting the
pedestal on which he afterwards stood as Emperor, who for twenty
years hung over Europe as a great shadow, keeping our ancestors
in this country in very pressing terror of invasion, whom the
British feared and hated, and whose dominant passion, as time
went on, was hatred of England as the insuperable obstacle in his
path of conquest.&nbsp; This little history will reveal to some
extent the results of his methods as they affected the
unfortunate soldiers <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>and sailors who became prisoners of war.&nbsp; This is no
place for discussing the right and wrong of the devastating
Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars; the treatment of the prisoners
of war, as shown in their prison life, alone finds its place in a
History of the Depot at Norman Cross.</p>
<p>At the commencement of the war the prisoners on either side
were comparatively few, but early in its progress embarrassment
arose on the British side from the large numbers of French and
Dutch taken in the great naval victories of Howe, Jervis,
Collingwood, and Nelson.&nbsp; To maintain these prisoners on a
foreign shore or in the face of the enemy was impossible, and as
their number increased it became evident that the existing
prisons, and the few fortresses remaining in Britain, such as
Porchester Castle near Portsmouth, Plymouth, Falmouth, and Fort
George in Scotland, which had been hurriedly fitted up and
converted into war prisons, were insufficient for the
ever-increasing number of captives.&nbsp; To supplement these it
became necessary to fit up special ships and maintain them as
hulks, in the harbours of Portsmouth, Plymouth, and the
Medway.&nbsp; These hulks were later used as places of
confinement for malefactors among the prisoners, and also to
relieve the prisons from overcrowding whenever an extraordinary
accumulation took place in the country.</p>
<p>In an article published in <i>Chambers&rsquo; Journal</i> in
1854, the writer points out &ldquo;the ships were large
battleships, they were cleared of all obstructions in each deck,
and would hold 900 men prisoners and the guard, without much
overcrowding; the mortality was very low.&rdquo; <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>The French in the hulks and the English prisoners in France
had undoubtedly to endure great hardships, but these hardships
did not justify the exaggerated charges brought by each nation
against the other&mdash;Englishmen pointing to Verdun as the
embodiment of <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>French cruelty and oppression, while Frenchmen enlarged
with bitter invectives on the condition of their countrymen in
the hulks and prison-ships in English harbours.&nbsp; This
exaggeration and these bitter recriminations went on to the end
of the war.&nbsp; Buonaparte himself was never tired of seeking
to arouse in the hearts of his soldiers a spirit of hatred
towards England by allusions to this subject, and before Waterloo
he included these words in his address to the Army:
&ldquo;Soldiers, let those among you who have been prisoners of
the English describe to you the hulks, and detail the frightful
miseries which they have endured.&rdquo; <a
name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a></p>
<p>The number of prisoners of war was so great that their care
had been handed over to a new department of the Admiralty thus
described:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Transport Office is a newly created
Board, and was instituted in July 1794 at first for the
superintendence of the Transport Service only; but to that
employment has since been added the management of the Prisoners
of War, in health, at home and abroad.&rdquo; <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this department all communications in reference to the
prisoners of war had to be addressed, and through them all
information reached the Admiralty.&nbsp; There was another
special department of the Admiralty, that for the care of the
sick and hurt, into whose charge the prisoners of war passed when
they ceased to be &ldquo;in health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following extract gives further details of the Transport
Department, on which for twenty years the lot of the prisoners of
war so greatly depended.&nbsp; The paragraph was written in 1803,
when the war was supposed to be at an end.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Transport Office, Dorset Square, Westminster,
established in August 1794, for the purpose of conducting the
transport business which had hitherto been transacted by the Navy
Office; it has also the care of the prisoners of war.&nbsp; It
was at first managed by three commissioners, but the business
having much increased two more were added in the year 1795.&nbsp;
The salary of each commissioner is a thousand a year.&nbsp; They
have under them, several resident agents at the different
sea-ports both at home and abroad, to superintend the particular
service of embarking, re-embarking of troops, etc., and seeing
that the contracts made in this particular service are strictly
adhered to.&nbsp; These agents are captains and lieutenants of
the Royal Navy.&nbsp; There are also several agents afloat.&nbsp;
The captains have one guinea a day; the lieutenants fifteen
shillings, and nineteen shillings more per month for a
servant.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the war in 1802, the Board
was reduced to three commissioners; Capt. Schank retired on a
pension of &pound;500 per annum, and Joseph Hunt, Esq., was
removed to the ordnance as clerk of the deliveries.</p>

<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>In order
properly to understand the establishment of the Depot at Norman
Cross, it is necessary to briefly review the events which led up
to it.&nbsp; It arose at a very momentous era in our
history.&nbsp; It was not officially called a barracks, or a
prison, but a Depot.&nbsp; At that time there were few barracks
in England, practically none, and what we term garrison towns
were very scarce.&nbsp; Our regular army was abroad fighting, and
the internal defence was in the hands of the Militia and
Yeomanry.&nbsp; Service in the former was compulsory, but
substitutes could be purchased, so that it is easy to judge who
would actually serve, especially at a time when scarcity and high
prices were the rule, while the Militia were well fed.&nbsp; In
the Yeomanry were enrolled the gentry and well-to-do persons of
each locality; this was a very large force.&nbsp; There was a
special troop of Norman Cross Yeomanry, in which the farmers and
others from the neighbouring villages gave their services, and
there were one or more troops in Peterborough and the
neighbouring towns.&nbsp; The duty mainly consisted in putting
down the various small riots that arose in different parts of the
country.&nbsp; In their travels they were &ldquo;billeted&rdquo;
on the publicans and the public at a tariff fixed by the
Government, and which, not being very extravagant, gave rise to
much dissatisfaction, oppression, and fraud.</p>
<p>As the foreign wars continued, the number of prisoners sent to
Britain multiplied and the military duty increased.&nbsp; In 1793
the Supplementary Militia Act was passed, and it was determined
to spend about &pound;2,000,000 in erecting barracks, and out of
this sum Norman Cross was built.&nbsp; It was always hoped that
peace was at hand, and the prisoners of war had hitherto been
confined not in places built for, or exactly suitable for, their
retention, but in fortresses or castles or ships, and when these
became overcrowded, in empty warehouses or similar buildings
specially hired.&nbsp; It was not <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>considered safe to keep prisoners of
war in sea-ports, or even near the coast.&nbsp; Ireland was in a
state of rebellion, and had to be kept down with a strong
military force, hence the great Depot at Kinsale was formed.</p>
<p>We must bear in mind that at this period the Parliamentary
Reports were very closely watched by our enemies, and information
which might be of service to them was suppressed and consequently
is sought for in vain to-day.&nbsp; The country was in a state of
turmoil, the Government departments were overladen to a terrible
degree, and red tape, far more than now, reigned supreme.&nbsp;
These conditions led to careless supervision and defalcations
even in high positions; the Barrack Master-General, General
Oliver de Lancey, was dismissed from the Army after a Commission
had investigated his accounts.&nbsp; He was responsible for
Norman Cross, and it is in accordance with the finding of the
commission referred to in this preface that no official account
of the original cost can be found.&nbsp; The ground was purchased
from Lord Carysfort. <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a>&nbsp; It is from measurements of
foundations remaining on the site, from plans, and from scattered
and brief references to reports, of which the originals cannot up
to the present be found, that a history and description of the
original buildings can be given.&nbsp; They were begun in haste,
hurriedly built, and in a continual state of repair and
alteration during the whole of their existence.</p>
<p>In 1793 a large sum of money was voted by Parliament for
barracks both permanent and temporary.&nbsp; A Barrack
Master-General had already been appointed.&nbsp; The first
measure taken by this official was the conversion of existing
buildings to meet their new object&mdash;viz. the safe custody of
the captive soldiers and sailors, and the provision of suitable
accommodation for lodging and maintaining them and the troops who
guarded them.&nbsp; <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Even in the first three years of the war these efforts
were barely sufficient to meet the requirements, and in February
1796 the matter of prison accommodation had become most
urgent.&nbsp; The Dutch Fleet was at sea, and a meeting with the
English Fleet being probable, it was reported to the Admiralty,
in reply to their inquiries as to the means of disposing of the
large number of prisoners expected in the event of a successful
battle, that Porchester Castle was capable of containing 2,000
men, and the Dutch prisoners could be kept separate from the
French.&nbsp; Forton would be of little use, as not more than 300
extra could be accommodated; it was already full, 6,000 being
incarcerated in the hospital there.</p>
<p>On the 20th June of the same year it was reported that the
number of prisoners had increased, until every prison was
overcrowded.&nbsp; At Mill Prison, Plymouth, calculated to hold
3,300, there were confined 3,513, and in consequence of the
report 200 were transferred from this prison into a ship; this in
turn also became crowded, and another ship had to be pressed into
the service.&nbsp; Fresh prisoners still poured into the
country.&nbsp; Sir Ralph Abercrombie reported that he was sending
upwards of 4,000 from the West Indies, and the urgency was such
that it became absolutely necessary to construct with the utmost
rapidity a new prison.</p>
<p>In selecting a site, several requirements had to be
considered.&nbsp; To be suitable for its purpose the prison must
be within easy reach of a port, in order that prisoners might be
landed, and conveyed rapidly and at small cost to their place of
confinement.&nbsp; At the same time it must not be too near an
unfortified port, as such a situation would offer facilities for
escape, and there would be danger of support from the sea, in the
event of a general rising, and a combined attempt to restore to
the fighting ranks of the enemy the thousands of captive soldiers
and sailors who were in captivity <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span><i>hors de combat</i>.&nbsp; The site
must be healthy, well supplied with water, and conveniently
situated for the provision of the necessaries of life&mdash;and
further, it must be near trunk roads, for convenience of
administration, and in order that in the event of a rising,
troops sufficient to quell the mutinous prisoners could be
concentrated on the spot.</p>
<p>The site chosen for the Norman Cross Depot possessed all these
advantages.&nbsp; It was situated on the Great North Road, one of
the most important in the country, the Ermine Street of the
Romans, and it was only seventy-six miles from London.&nbsp; The
situation was altogether suitable from a sanitary point of view,
although later, at a period when the bulk were ill clad, the poor
half-naked French, accustomed to a warmer climate, complained
bitterly of its cold and exposed position.&nbsp; An abundant
supply of excellent water could be obtained by sinking deep
wells, the surrounding country was agricultural, the land fertile
and well stocked; there were small towns near from which supplies
could be obtained, and, finally, the transports could be brought
to the ports of Yarmouth, Lynn, or Wisbech, and the prisoners
landed there could be cheaply conveyed by water to Yaxley,
Stanground, and Peterborough, all of which places were within a
few miles&rsquo; march from the prison gates.&nbsp; As an
alternative the prisoner could march direct from the ports to the
prison.</p>
<p>On the 8th December 1796 the Transport Commissioners applied
to the Barrack Office for estimates for a building to contain
10,000 prisoners, but official red tape could not be disregarded,
and the Barrack Master-General replied that as the Admiralty had
not authorised the construction of any such buildings, he could
not give any opinion on the subject.&nbsp; In the Transport
Office, however, were officials who recognised the urgency of the
situation, and when at length on the 13th February 1797 the
Barrack Master-General wrote to the Transport Board, referring to
his letter of the 19th December <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>of the previous year, and asking for
an order for the building, he was too late.&nbsp; The Transport
Commissioners were already at work, the prison had been planned,
and the work, started in the previous December, was, under the
direction of William Adams, Master Carpenter to the Board of
Ordnance, already making such rapid progress that portions were
nearly complete.</p>
<p>The material selected for the structure was wood; this was
economical, and suited to the temporary character of the
building.&nbsp; No one, however pessimistic, thought in 1796 that
the prison would be required to house prisoners of war, with only
two short intervals, for another nineteen years.&nbsp; Such
wooden buildings, the outer walls constructed of a strong
framework, with feather-edged boards overlapping one another
covering and casing in the framed work, were much used in
domestic architecture at this period, and many houses thus
constructed may be seen in the neighbourhood of London.&nbsp; A
good example of a village mansion of this kind may be still seen
in Lower Sydenham, where it is at present occupied by Lady Grove,
the widow of Sir George Grove.&nbsp; The wooden buildings were
erected on a buried brick or stone foundation.</p>
<p>Above all, wood lent itself to rapidity of construction, which
was an urgent and essential requirement at this crisis.</p>
<p>When nine years later, in 1805, fresh accommodation for the
ever-increasing number of prisoners flowing into Great Britain
was necessary, and Dartmoor was selected as the site for a new
prison, granite was the material adopted for its
construction.&nbsp; The stone was obtainable on the spot, while
the price of timber was prohibitive, in consequence of the
blockading of the Prussian ports. <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>The granite
prison at Dartmoor, commenced in 1805, received its first batch
of prisoners in May 1809.&nbsp; The stone building took four
years to build, it served its original purpose for seven years,
stood empty for thirty-four years, and is at the present time,
and has been for sixty-one years, a convict prison.&nbsp; The
wooden buildings of Norman Cross, commenced in 1796, were ready
for use in four months, served their purpose for eighteen years,
and were rased to the ground in 1816.</p>
<p>The earliest official information, as to the plan and the
buildings of the Depot, is found in a long report by General
Beathand dated 13th January 1797; later official reports and
documents, paragraphs in the newspapers, and other sources of
information show that the original plans were modified and
expanded as the work of the prison progressed.</p>
<p>The timber framework of the building was made in London, and
was carted down to Norman Cross, where 500 carpenters and others
were employed day and night, and seven days a week, those who
would not work on Sunday being discharged.&nbsp; The erection of
the prisons, the accessory offices, and the barracks for the
Military Guard progressed very rapidly, and on the 4th February
(nine days before the Barrack Master-General applied for the
order to start the work!) such progress had been made that the
Admiralty instructed Mr. Poore, a surveyor, to proceed to Stilton
&ldquo;to survey the buildings erected near there for the
confinement of prisoners of war.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did so, and
reported that a portion of the building was already
complete.&nbsp; General Nicolls, the officer commanding the
district, was sanguine enough to report on the 13th February that
the prison at Norman Cross would be ready in about three weeks
for the reception of prisoners from the citadel (Plymouth).</p>
<p>This estimate of the date when the barracks would be finished
was too sanguine, although the work was being <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>carried out
with all possible speed.&nbsp; By the end of January the sum of
&pound;6,000 had been paid to and disbursed by Mr. Adams in wages
alone. <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a></p>
<p>The total amount paid on account of the Norman Cross Depot up
to the 19th November 1797 being so large, while the large
expenditure on the alterations of old prisons and fortresses in
the country was going on simultaneously, it is not surprising
that on the 14th April 1797 a question was asked by an economist
in the House of Commons as to the extraordinary expenditure on
barracks; nor, looking to the rate at which the building of the
Norman Cross Depot was being pushed forward, can we be surprised
at the curt reply of the Secretary of State: &ldquo;Extraordinary
exertions involve extraordinary expenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is reason to believe, however, that the question was not
put without good reason.&nbsp; The want of method and the
overlapping of departments were not conducive to clear statements
of accounts.&nbsp; The action of the newly appointed Transport
Board in commencing the building of the prison, while the Barrack
Master was refusing to undertake this urgent work because he
considered that official routine had been neglected, has already
been alluded to.&nbsp; The Barrack Master&rsquo;s Accounts <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>were very
confused.&nbsp; In the Records of the Audit Office (Roll 354,
Bundle 146, Declared Accounts) the total expenditure by the
Barrack Master at Norman Cross, from 1st January 1797 to
Christmas 1802, is only &pound;5,175 3<i>s.</i>, and it is
evident that the sum of &pound;34,518 11<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> does
not appear in the Barrack Master&rsquo;s account.&nbsp; The total
expenditure of his department amounted, when an inquiry was held,
in 1802 to &pound;1,324,680 12<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> and there was
a deficiency of &pound;40,296 9<i>s.</i> 11&frac14;<i>d.</i></p>
<p>Out of the confused chaos of figures there emerges the
interesting fact that, between the 25th December 1796 and the
24th June 1797, &pound;390 10<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> was spent on
coals supplied to the Norman Cross Depot!&nbsp; A large coal bill
for half a year, when we consider that in none of the blocks
occupied by the prisoners, excepting the hospital blocks, was
there any artificial heat.</p>
<p>As the work went on, there were, as has been already stated,
various alterations in the plans; thus in February and March 1797
it was ordered, that a hospital for the sick should be provided
by adapting some of the blocks originally intended as prisons to
this purpose, and that increased accommodation for prisoners
should be obtained by adding a storey to each block in course of
erection, in preference to multiplying the buildings.</p>
<p>On 21st March a payment was made to Mr. Poore of &pound;142
2<i>s.</i> for his services in surveying and <i>settling the
establishment</i> at Norman Cross.&nbsp; This shows that within
three months from the commencement of the buildings they were in
a sufficiently advanced condition to make the consideration of
the necessary staff for the administration of the prison when it
should be opened, a matter requiring Mr. Poore&rsquo;s immediate
attention.</p>
<p>By the 25th March the staff had been engaged, and on that day
it was reported that a section of the buildings, sufficient for
the custody of 1,840 prisoners, was ready for their
reception.&nbsp; On the day before this report was sent, a
portion of the military barracks had <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>been occupied by the small number of
troops considered sufficient for the moment.&nbsp; These marched
in on the 24th, and were ready to mount guard over the expected
prisoners.</p>
<p>The work of building went rapidly on during the rest of the
year, and nine months from its commencement Mr. Craig, a
principal architect of the department, was sent down for the
final inspection.&nbsp; As will be seen by the footnote, page 14,
payments to W. Adams, Chief Carpenter, went on up to 29th
November 1797, when we may assume that the prison in its first
form was complete.</p>
<p>From the time of its occupation, this prison was, like others
of its class, known as a &ldquo;depot&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
Norman Cross Depot for Prisoners of War.&rdquo;&nbsp; Locally it
was frequently spoken of and written about as the Norman Cross
Prison, or the Norman Cross Barracks, or even Yaxley or Stilton
Barracks.&nbsp; The term depot included the prison proper, the
barracks, and all other Government buildings.&nbsp; In the
succeeding chapter this Depot is fully described, and its
necessary establishment touched upon. <a name="citation16"></a><a

<p class="gutsumm">THE PRISON AND ITS ESTABLISHMENT</p>
<blockquote><p>It is no flattery to a prisoner to gild his
dungeon.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Calderon</span>,
<i>Fortunas de Andromed et Persus</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following description of the
Depot is founded on personal observations of the site, on
contemporary plans and records, of greater or less accuracy, on
the meagre information which could be obtained from the few old
people who had in their early days seen and known the place, and
who were still alive in 1894, when the materials for the lecture
on which this narrative is based were collected, and on facts
recorded by recent writers the accuracy of which can be
verified.</p>
<p>The site of the Depot was a space of forty-two acres, situated
in the angle formed where, seventy-six miles from London,
&ldquo;the Great North Road&rdquo; is joined, five miles from
Peterborough by the old Coach Road from Boston and East
Lincolnshire.</p>
<p>The ground rises here, by a rapid slope from the south and
east, to a height of 120 feet above the level of the adjoining
Fens, and it was in this elevated and healthy spot that the
prison and barracks were built.&nbsp; It had been ascertained
that by sinking deep wells an abundant supply of good water could
be obtained, and it is said that there were about thirty such
wells, although in the best extant plan of the Depot nineteen
only are shown.&nbsp; Some of these are still in use at the
present day, and each well is nearly 100 feet deep.&nbsp; Great
attention was paid to the sanitary arrangements, a very necessary
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>matter,
when one considers that it was resolved suddenly to concentrate
in one spot a population (including prisoners and garrison) of
nearly 8,000 adult males, who were to live for several years on
about forty acres of ground.&nbsp; There is a legend that the
site is even now honeycombed with sewers, and that within recent
years a ferret turned into one of them, which had been
accidentally opened, at once took out 150 yards of line.&nbsp;
This, like many other traditions, is not, I believe, founded on
fact.&nbsp; The main feature of the sanitary arrangements was
that all refuse should be removed in soil carts, without the
intervention of drains, cess-pools, or middens.&nbsp; For further
information on this and many other matters connected with the
structure of the Depot, the reader may study the <i>Report of a
Survey</i> by Mr. Fearnall in 1813.&nbsp; It is evident from this
report that the maintenance and repair of the buildings had been
greatly neglected during the seventeen years which had elapsed
between their erection and the date of the report. <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p>The Peterborough Natural History Society, which has in its
museum the finest collection in Great Britain, if not in the
world, of straw marquetry work, bone carving, and other artistic
manufactures executed by the French prisoners, possesses three
plans of the prison.&nbsp; The earliest of these is a pictorial
plan (Plate II., Fig. 1, Plan A), which was bought at a sale at
Washingley Hall, and which I therefore call the Washingley
Plan.&nbsp; It was presented in 1906 by the Mayor, T. Lamplugh,
Esq.; it is an east elevation.&nbsp; Another (Plate II., Fig. 2,
Plan B) of about the same date is a ground plan, and was
presented by Miss Hill, the daughter of the late Mr. John
Hill.&nbsp; This is taken from the west.&nbsp; Mr. Hill, who was
born in 1803, and was thus only thirteen when the prison was
demolished, was said to have drawn the plan himself; if he did
so, it must have been copied from one made a few years before he
was born, as the plan <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>is that of the Depot in the first
period of the war, which came to a close in March 1802.</p>

<p>Both these plans are of a very early date in the history of
the prison.&nbsp; A third (Plate II., Fig. 3, Plan C) is that
which belonged to Major Kelly, who, as Captain Kelly, was
Brigade-Major at the time when the prison was closed; this
includes a pictorial plan, or bird&rsquo;s-eye view, with the
Peterborough Road on the south to the left hand and the North
Road above, a ground plan, and above this the north elevation of
the whole group of buildings.&nbsp; It is of later date, probably
about 1803&ndash;4, the commencement of the second period of the
war.&nbsp; A fourth plan (Plate II., Fig. 4, Plan D) was made by
Lieut. Macgregor of the West Kent Militia, and dedicated to the
officers of his regiment which was quartered at Norman Cross in
1813.&nbsp; This was engraved and published by Sylvester of the
Strand.&nbsp; An almost perfect copy of the print is in the
possession of the Reverend Father Robert A. Davis; it shows the
Depot in its final state two years before Waterloo and three
years before it was demolished.</p>
<p>In the Mus&eacute;e de l&rsquo;Arm&eacute;e at the H&ocirc;tel
des Invalides in Paris, is a model of the Depot, the work of a
French prisoner named Foulley, who was confined at Norman Cross
five years and three months.&nbsp; M. Foulley constructed the
model after his return to France.&nbsp; It represents the prison
as it appeared on the occasion of the rejoicings at the departure
of the first detachment of prisoners to France after the entry of
the allied armies into Paris, and the abdication of Buonaparte in
1814.&nbsp; By the courtesy of General Niox, the Director of the
Museum, and of his Adjutant, Lieut. Sculfort, a photograph of the
model has been taken for me; this is reproduced at page 251,
chapter xii., where the final clearing of the prison is
described.&nbsp; The model corresponds in its main features with
the plans which I have enumerated.&nbsp; It is on a large scale,
beautifully executed, and its <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>production must have required months
of hard work.&nbsp; It is the only plan, or model, which shows a
prisoners&rsquo; theatre in the centre of the south-east
quadrangle.</p>
<p>M. Foulley&rsquo;s model is incorrect in certain
details.&nbsp; It represents the prison wall as quadrilateral
inclosing a square, instead of an octagonal space.&nbsp; It omits
the large and deep embrasures, in the recesses of which each of
the four gates of the prison stood.&nbsp; The wide fosse which
encircled the prison at the foot of and within the wall is
omitted, nor is there a sufficient space left between the wall
and the prison buildings to admit of such a fosse being shown in
the model.</p>
<p>Outside the wall of the prison M. Foulley had to rely probably
on the description of others, as from within the wall the
prisoners could only gaze at its dismal brick surface.&nbsp; Of
what was beyond he could have no personal knowledge during the
long years of his captivity, unless he was fortunate enough on
occasions to be a delegate to the market without the Eastern
Gate.&nbsp; Hence probably it arises that the buildings
representing the quarters of the military guarding the prison are
huddled together, in confused order, which bears no relation to
that which was their actual position.</p>
<p>Although the model is not, as a whole, made accurately to
scale, the reader will appreciate its size from the fact that the
caserns are modelled on a scale of about 1 to 171&mdash;the
actual length of each casern was 100 feet, the length in the
model is nearly 7 inches.&nbsp; A key plan of the model and M.
Foulley&rsquo;s description are given with the photograph in
chapter xii., p. 251.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion in following the description, the reader
must bear in mind that the Washingley Pictorial Plan, Major
Kelly&rsquo;s plans, and Lieut. Macgregor&rsquo;s plan are all
east elevations&mdash;that is, the observer is supposed to face
the west, with the Peterborough Road to his left
hand&mdash;whereas in the plan copied by Mr. Hill the figures and
their references are all placed to be read as <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>the observer
looks east, with the Peterborough Road on his right hand;
therefore the left-hand bottom corner (where the military
hospital was situated) in Mr. Hill&rsquo;s Plan is the right-hand
upper corner in the three other plans.</p>
<p>The site was a right-angled oblong, with a small space sliced
off at the north-west angle.&nbsp; It measured in its long
diameter from east to west 500 yards (1,500 feet)&mdash;that is,
60 yards more than a quarter of a mile&mdash;while across from
north to south it was 412 yards (1,236 feet), or 28 yards short
of a quarter of a mile.&nbsp; The space enclosed was 42 acres, 7
poles, which is about six times the area of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn
Fields, London, and about four times that of Trafalgar
Square.&nbsp; To the south it was bounded in its whole length by
the Peterborough Road, on its other three sides it was surrounded
with fields.&nbsp; A strip of land (B B in Mr. Hill&rsquo;s
plan), crossed by a wide roadway leading to the West Barracks,
and varying in depth from 125 yards at the Norman Cross corner to
40 yards at the north-west corner, intervened between the western
boundary of the site and the North Road.&nbsp; The prison itself
occupied 22 acres in the centre of the space.&nbsp; It was
enclosed by an octagonal brick wall.&nbsp; Originally the
structure was a strong stockade fence, but about the year 1805
the fence was replaced by the brick wall, of which 30 yards are
still standing.</p>
<p>The two east and two west sides of the octagonal space, which
was the prison proper, were longer than the two north and two
south sides; the long diameter of the octagon therefore ran
across that of the site, extending almost to its north and south
limits, while the short diameter stopping short of the boundary
by 300 feet, left, east and west, ample room for the barracks of
the military garrison and for other buildings.</p>
<p>In the very centre of the site, which is also the centre of
the prison, was an octagonal block house, mounted <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>with
cannon.&nbsp; This is represented in the illustration, a
photograph of one of several models made by the prisoners.&nbsp;
This model is in the possession of Colonel Strong of Thorpe Hall,
by whose grandfather Archdeacon Strong it was bought from its
maker at the prison.</p>

"Plate III.&mdash;The Block House which stood in the Centre of
the Prison"
src="images/p22s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The frontispiece is from a sketch of the centre of the prison,
by Captain George Lloyd of the Second West York Militia, taken in
1809.&nbsp; The original is in the collection of the United
Service Institution, Whitehall; it shows the accuracy of the
model of the block house.&nbsp; In describing the various courts
and buildings, it is best to start from the centre, and to trace
the arrangement of the parts of the Depot round this point.&nbsp;
Symmetrically arranged round this block house, and commanded by
its guns, were four quadrangular courts, each strongly fenced by
a high stockade fence.&nbsp; The area of each of these courts was
about 3&frac12; acres; they were separated from one another by
four cross roads, each about twenty feet wide.&nbsp; These roads
met in the centre, where the corners of the quadrangular courts
were cut off to form the octagonal open space in which stood the
block house.</p>
<p>Each quadrangle contained four wooden two-storied barracks, or
caserns, 100 feet long and 22 feet wide, roofed with red tiles,
the shallowness of their depth from back to front adding to their
apparent height.&nbsp; The sixteen buildings faced the east,
eight with their outer ends to the south fence, and eight with
their outer end to the north fence.&nbsp; The four caserns in
each square were placed one behind the other, leaving between
each block and the next in front a space which was strongly
fenced off at either end, forming an enclosure about 100 by 70
feet, in which the prisoners of each casern were confined when
the gates opening into the quadrangle, or airing-ground, were
locked at sunset.&nbsp; Each casern was constructed to form the
dwelling-place of about 500 prisoners, who slept in <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>rows of
hammocks, closely packed in tiers one above the other.&nbsp; It
is almost certain that each of the two floors in these caserns
was divided by partitions into three chambers, as at the sale
each of the sixteen was sold in three lots&mdash;the north end,
the centre, and the south end.&nbsp; The north end of the hinder
block in the north-east quadrangle was bought on the 25th
September 1816 by Mr. Dan Ruddle for &pound;32. <a
name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a>&nbsp; He re-erected it for workshops
in his building-yard, where it still stands, and it is thus
possible to-day, to look upon the north end of the casern (No.
13, or letter M), which stood behind the three blocks adapted for
the prisoners&rsquo; hospital, and which in the second period of
the war <a name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a> was occupied by the French petty
officers and by civilians who were captured, and whose position
did not entitle them to parole.</p>
<p>In the south-east quadrangle, which was on the right of the
central south entrance to the prison from the Peterborough Road,
there were, in addition to these four caserns and their necessary
offices, the superintendent&rsquo;s, or agent&rsquo;s offices, a
storehouse, a room set apart for the clerks and other officials,
a cooking-house, and, as in each of the other quadrangles, two
turnkeys&rsquo; lodges.</p>
<p>These smaller buildings in each quadrangle were in a court,
cut off from the large space which formed the prisoners&rsquo;
airing-ground by stockade fencing similar to that surrounding the
whole quadrangle, the turnkeys&rsquo; lodges being immediately
behind this fence.&nbsp; The only exit from the part of the
quadrangle occupied by the prisoners was through this court, the
gate situated in the inner stockade fence being between the two
turnkeys&rsquo; lodges, facing another in the main fence of the
square, which opened into the road between the quadrangles.&nbsp;
There were in each quadrangle three wells, two in the
airing-courts near the caserns, and one in the enclosed space in
which were the accessory buildings.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>In the
south-western quadrangle, in addition to the caserns, the
storehouse, and the cooking-house, there was a straw barn, from
which, whenever necessary, fresh straw was served out for the
prisoners&rsquo; palliasses.&nbsp; In the enclosed court near the
turnkeys&rsquo; lodges was the black hole, where prisoners were
confined for gross offences.&nbsp; This den of misery contained
twelve cells, each secured by bars and padlocks, and had a
cramped strongly fenced airing-court in front of it.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The north-eastern quadrangle was mainly given up to the
hospital.&nbsp; Of the four caserns in the early years of the
Depot, two, but later three, were fitted up for the reception of
the sick and wounded and for the accommodation of the surgeon and
assistant surgeons, the matron sempstress and the hospital
attendants.&nbsp; Of the hospital blocks, one was set apart for
the officers and other prisoners of similar social status.&nbsp;
In the enclosed court behind the turnkeys&rsquo; lodges were the
special accessory buildings of the hospital, and in the corner
behind the caserns was the mortuary, where, between their death
and their burial, were laid the bodies of 1,770 unhappy men whose
fate it was to end their captivity in a foreign grave.</p>
<p>In this quadrangle, as shown in Lieut. Macgregor&rsquo;s plan,
was, in the year 1805, erected the surgeon&rsquo;s house, which
was a substantial brick building, with an enclosed garden; this
was built in the second period of the war after the Peace of
Amiens, about eleven years before the demolition of the
barracks.&nbsp; After the closing of the Depot, when peace was
declared in 1814, we find Mr. George Walker the surgeon, on
vacating his post, making application for permission to remove
the young fruit trees which he had planted in the apparently
newly laid-out garden. <a name="citation24"></a><a
href="#footnote24" class="citation">[24]</a>&nbsp; In each
quadrangle <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>a space of about two acres was unoccupied by buildings,
and constituted the airing-ground, in which the prisoners spent
the greater part of their waking lives.&nbsp; This outdoor life,
from sunrise to sunset, except in bad weather, was enforced by
the Prison Regulations.</p>
<p>These airing-courts were bordered by a flag pavement, which
enabled the prisoners to use them in any but the worst
weather.</p>
<p>Completely surrounding the four quadrangles, and enclosing
around them a vacant space, varying in width from 25 to 30 yards
opposite the cross roads, to as many <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>feet at the abutting angles of each
quadrangle, was the prison wall.&nbsp; This in the earlier years
was a strong stockade fence, and is so represented in the three
earlier plans reproduced in the plates; but at a later date it
was replaced by the brick wall shown in Macgregor&rsquo;s plan,
and it is described in the auctioneer&rsquo;s catalogue of the
sale, when the prison and its contents were disposed of in
September 1816, as &ldquo;a substantial brick wall measuring
3,740 feet round, and containing 282 rods of brickwork more or
less.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this wall, 30 yards are still standing,
forming a portion of the garden wall of the house originally
occupied by the superintendent.&nbsp; The auctioneer&rsquo;s
description does not altogether agree with that of the surveyor
Mr. Fearnall, who in 1813 reported that it was &ldquo;very
indifferently built, and not of the best materials,&rdquo; and
that much of it was in danger of falling, owing to the excavation
at its foot within the enclosure of a ditch.&nbsp; This ditch,
for its full length of nearly three-quarters of a mile, can be
traced at the present day, with the deep embrasures shown in the
plans, at each of the four prison gates.&nbsp; It was, at the
time the buildings were demolished, about 9 yards wide and 5 feet
deep, and it was paved with stone flags; this is supposed to be
the &ldquo;silent walk&rdquo; of the sentries, excavated in
1809.&nbsp; An item in the barrack master&rsquo;s accounts for
July in that year is &pound;420 19<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, for the
making a walk for the &ldquo;silent sentries.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
area of the actual prison enclosed within the wall was in 1816
sold in one lot, and is described in the catalogue as
&ldquo;containing by admeasurement 22 acres, 2 roods, and 14
perches more or less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the boundary wall were four gates, opening on to the ends
of the cross streets, which separated the four quadrangles.&nbsp;
The north gate opened into a space at the back of the prison
occupied by sheds and other accessories; the east and west gates
on roadways which ran between the military barracks and the
prison <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>from the Peterborough Road; the south gate was opposite
the central main entrance from that road into the Depot.&nbsp;
Later, as shown in Macgregor&rsquo;s plan, there were, in
addition to these four large gates, a door in the south wall
adjoining the house of the agent, or superintendent, and another
in the north wall, giving admission to a court outside the wall,
in which had been erected a separate prison for the boys.</p>
<p>At each gate outside the prison wall was a guard house, a
one-storied building fitted with separate rooms for the officers
and men of the guard, with cells for prisoners, and with a
wide-open shelter, or verandah, in front.</p>
<p>The ground between the boundary wall and the quadrangles was
not built upon, but was studded over with the boxes of the
sentries, who, with muskets loaded with ball cartridge, day and
night patrolled the vacant area, ready to fire on any prisoner
attempting to escape across it who did not obey the order to
halt.</p>
<p>Beyond the boundary wall of the prison were situated east and
west the military barracks.&nbsp; These comprised at each end
three large caserns, similar to those in the prison, built to
enclose, with the guard house, the barrack square.&nbsp; The
casern facing the guard house was the officers&rsquo; quarters,
and was partitioned off into twenty-three separate
officers&rsquo; rooms, a mess-room, kitchen, and other
offices.&nbsp; Those at either side accommodated the private
soldiers; they were divided into ten separate rooms, each with
sleeping-berths for sixty men.&nbsp; There were two smaller
buildings for the non-commissioned officers, a large canteen,
sutling-house, and various offices.&nbsp; The whole of these
buildings, with the barrack yards, were enclosed by strong
stockade fencing.&nbsp; Outside this fence there was, in the
space allotted to the accommodation of the troops, east and west
of the prison, a detached house for the field officers, two
smaller houses for the staff sergeants, the powder <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>magazine, a
fire-engine house, a range of stabling, with stalls for
thirty-five horses, <a name="citation28a"></a><a
href="#footnote28a" class="citation">[28a]</a> rooms for the
batmen, a schoolroom, and various other necessary offices and
sheds.</p>
<p>The Military Hospital occupied the north-west corner of the
forty-two acres; it served for the whole of the troops in both
barracks, and was complete in itself.&nbsp; It was enclosed
within a separate stockade fence.</p>
<p>On the south side of the area, between the boundary wall and
the Peterborough Road, were the houses of the barrack master, and
of the agent (or superintendent).&nbsp; These are still standing,
the former having been purchased, when the prison and barracks
were demolished and the site and materials sold, by Captain Kelly
(Brevet Major, 1854), the last Brigade-Major.&nbsp; This officer
had, in 1814, married the daughter of Mr. Vise, a surgeon
practising in Stilton, <a name="citation28b"></a><a
href="#footnote28b" class="citation">[28b]</a> and, wishing to
settle in the neighbourhood, he purchased the first of the lots
into which the freehold was divided, and in which was situated
the barrack master&rsquo;s house, described in the catalogue as
&ldquo;a comfortable house in the cottage stile,&rdquo;
&ldquo;built of substantial fir carcase-framing and rough
weather-boarding on brick footings, and covered with
pantiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>To this
house Major Kelly made considerable additions.&nbsp; It was
occupied by him for forty years.&nbsp; He died, aged
seventy-eight, in 1858. <a name="citation29"></a><a
href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a>&nbsp; His son
Captain J. Kelly succeeded <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>him, and the property has now passed
into the hands of Mr. J. A. Herbert, J.P., the present occupant
of the house.&nbsp; It is a useful landmark to those who visit
the locality, as with its grounds it occupies the south-east
corner of the forty-two acres, which were covered by the prison
and barracks, and it forms a useful point from which to start in
an attempt to conjure up the Depot as it was at the beginning of
the last century.&nbsp; The first effort of the imagination must
be to blot out the charming residence with its well-wooded
grounds, and to substitute the bare, treeless (except for one old
ash) spot on which stood the &ldquo;comfortable house in the
cottage stile, consisting of one room 20 ft. by 12 ft. 2 in., one
ditto 14 ft. 8 in. by 12 ft. 3 in. . . . built of substantial fir
carcase-framing and rough weather-boarding on brick footings, and
covered with pantiles&rdquo;&mdash;which was what Captain Kelly
bought in 1816. <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>Immediately to the west of the barrack master&rsquo;s house
was the straw barn and yard, in which was stored the straw for
the beds of the soldiers.&nbsp; Beyond the barn was a gate, from
which a road or street ran across between the prison proper and
the east barracks.&nbsp; Through this gate passed all those who
came to attend the market at the east gate of the prison, or on
other business.&nbsp; Beyond this gate was the house of the
superintendent, or agent, who was practically the governor of the
prison.&nbsp; The block contained two houses, the second being
occupied by other officials.&nbsp; These houses, like the barrack
master&rsquo;s, remain at the present time where they stood in
the twenty years of the prison&rsquo;s existence, but they have
been much altered, and are now surrounded by trees and shrubs, of
which the ground was absolutely bare in the days of the
prison.</p>

<p>The superintendent&rsquo;s and the adjoining house were <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>cased with
brick in 1816 by the purchaser, Captain Handslip, and were thrown
into one house, which is now occupied by Mr. Franey.&nbsp; In the
catalogue of the sale they are described as &ldquo;two excellent
contiguous dwelling-houses, built of substantial fir
carcase-framing, and stuccoed, with lead flat top.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another range of buildings, 100 feet long, &ldquo;comprising a
large storeroom, coach-house, stable, etc.,&rdquo; also stood on
this south side between the prison wall and the road, while in
the centre was the main entrance, with, beyond and to the west of
the gate, the south guard house.</p>
<p>On the ground plan are shown four entrances to the
depot&mdash;three from the Peterborough Road, the centre entrance
just mentioned, and two others, one at either end, the roads from
which ran between the barracks and the prison.&nbsp; The fourth
entrance was approached from the North Road by a broad drive,
crossing the narrow field lying between the prison and the Great
North Road, from which it is now, as then, fenced off on either
side.&nbsp; This entrance was exactly opposite the centre of the
Western Military Barracks, the main guard facing it.&nbsp; It was
by this western entrance that the stores and provisions were
daily brought into the prison, <a name="citation31"></a><a
href="#footnote31" class="citation">[31]</a> and through it the
bodies of those who died were carried to the prison cemetery on
the opposite side of the North Road.</p>
<p>Macgregor&rsquo;s plan shows a paled fence surrounding the
forty-two acres and forming the outer boundary of the whole site,
but this may have been a mere artistic finish to the plan.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>The
prison and barracks were excellently planned, although, as a
place of safe custody, the former would have been practically
useless without the latter.</p>
<p>The guns of the block house commanding the whole prison, the
cordon of sentries frequently changed, always alert, ceaselessly
pacing their beats within and without the wall, day and night;
the strong guard mounted at each gate of the prison, and the
large force of military in the two barracks, ready to act on the
slightest alarm, constituted a more efficient safeguard against
mutiny or escape than would have been afforded had trust been
placed in strong stone structures instead of in the wooden walls
and buildings which had been so rapidly run up.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1911, when the heat and drought were
exceptional, the stone and rubble footings upon which the wooden
buildings were erected were, after the first few showers of rain,
in many parts of the site, mapped out clearly in brown on a field
of green, the grass upon them having withered, so that it could
not spring up fresh as it did in the surrounding pastures.&nbsp;
This enabled the author to demonstrate the actual size of the
buildings, and to correct many measurements which had been taken
from the plans.&nbsp; It also proved that none of the extant
plans were drawn to scale.</p>
<p>These are the dry details taken from actual measurements on
the ground, from surveyors&rsquo; plans, and similar documents,
but we have a word-picture of the effect produced by these wooden
buildings and their inhabitants on the mind of an imaginative and
emotional boy, who afterwards became one of the most picturesque
writers of the middle part of the nineteenth century.&nbsp;
George Borrow&rsquo;s father was quartered at Norman Cross in
1812&ndash;13, and his little boy, not yet in his teens, was
moved from Norwich to this place.&nbsp; Forty years later, in the
pages of <i>Lavengro</i>, he thus describes in eloquent language
the vivid, if not absolutely accurate <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>picture which the prison had
impressed upon his receptive and observant brain.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And a strange place it was, this Norman
Cross, and, at the time of which I am speaking, a sad cross to
many a Norman, being what was then styled a French prison, that
is, a receptacle for captives made in the French war.&nbsp; It
consisted, if I remember right, of some five or six casernes,
very long, and immensely high; each standing isolated from the
rest, upon a spot of ground which might average ten acres, and
which was fenced round with lofty palisades, the whole being
compassed about by a towering wall, beneath which, at intervals,
on both sides sentinels were stationed, whilst, outside, upon the
field, stood commodious wooden barracks, capable of containing
two regiments of infantry, intended to serve as guards upon the
captives.&nbsp; Such was the station or prison at Norman Cross,
where some six thousand French and other foreigners, followers of
the grand Corsican, were now immured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange appearance had those mighty casernes,
with their blank blind walls, without windows or grating, and
their slanting roofs, out of which, through orifices where the
tiles had been removed, would be protruded dozens of grim heads,
feasting their prison-sick eyes on the wide expanse of country
unfolded from that airy height.&nbsp; Ah! there was much misery
in those casernes; and from those roofs, doubtless, many a
wistful look was turned in the direction of lovely France.&nbsp;
Much had the poor inmates to endure, and much to complain of, to
the disgrace of England be it said&mdash;of England, in general
so kind and bountiful.&nbsp; Rations of carrion meat, and bread
from which I have seen the very hounds occasionally turn away,
were unworthy entertainment even for the most ruffian enemy, when
helpless and a captive; and such, alas! was the fare in these
casernes.&nbsp; And then, those visits, or rather <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>ruthless
inroads, called in the slang of the place &lsquo;straw-plait
hunts,&rsquo; when, in pursuit of a contraband article, which the
prisoners, in order to procure themselves a few of the
necessaries and comforts of existence, were in the habit of
making, red-coated battalions were marched into the prisons, who,
with the bayonet&rsquo;s point, carried havoc and ruin into every
poor convenience which ingenious wretchedness had been
endeavouring to raise around it; and then the triumphant exit
with the miserable booty; and, worst of all, the accursed
bonfire, on the barrack parade, of the plait contraband, beneath
the view of the glaring eyeballs from those lofty roofs, amidst
the hurrahs of the troops, frequently drowned in the curses
poured down from above like a tempest-shower, or in the terrific
war-whoop of &lsquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another writer records his impression of the Depot, which he
visited in 1807.&nbsp; The quotation is from an article in
<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 8th series, vol. x., p. 197, which
gives an account of a trip to Peterborough made by the Rev.
Robert Forby, vicar of Fincham, and a Mr. G. Miller of the same
place.&nbsp; They started on their tour on the 25th June 1807,
and the vicar chronicles his visit to Norman Cross in the
following words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pursuing our journey through suffocating
clouds of dust, in the evening we reached Stilton, a miserable
shabby town, where all we found to admire was some excellent
cheese for our supper. <a name="citation34"></a><a
href="#footnote34" class="citation">[34]</a>&nbsp; Having
disposed of our horses at the inn and secured our own lodgings,
we walked back a mile or so to Norman Cross to see <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the barracks
for French prisoners, no less than 6,000 of whom are confined
here.&nbsp; It is a fine healthy spot.&nbsp; Among them there is
very little disease; their good looks in general prove the
excellent care taken of them.&nbsp; In particular the boys are
kept apart and taught, so that in all probability their captivity
is a benefit to them.&nbsp; Their dexterity in little handicraft,
nick-nacks, particularly in making toys of the bones of their
meals, will put many pounds into the pockets of several of
them.&nbsp; We were very credibly assured that there are some who
will carry away with them &pound;200 or &pound;300.&nbsp; Their
behaviour was not at all impudent or disrespectful as we passed
the pallisades within which they are cooped.&nbsp; Most of them
have acquired English enough to chatter very volubly and to cheat
adroitly.&nbsp; They are guarded by two regiments of Militia, one
of them the Cambridge; we had the advantage of knowing Captain
Pemberton of that regiment, who gave us tea in his
luggage-lumbered hut.&nbsp; The country is under very great
obligations to gentlemen of family and fortune who will forego
the comforts of home for the miserable inconveniences of barrack
service.&nbsp; We had never seen it before, and have not the
least wish to see it again.&nbsp; It is horrible.&nbsp; The only
privacy of an officer by day or night is in these wretched
hovels, in which they must alternately sweat and shiver.&nbsp;
The mess-room is open indeed at all hours.&nbsp; It is a
coffee-room, news room, lounging-room, at all times, as well as
that of dinner, to the officers of a regiment.&nbsp; Between
eight and nine o&rsquo;clock we found two who had outstayed the
others; they were boozy and still at their wine, merely perhaps
from having nothing to do.&nbsp; Our friend, who is a man of
great good sense and exemplary manners, must be strangely out of
his element here.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wretched hovels of which Mr. Forby speaks were the rooms
in the officers&rsquo; barracks, the walls of <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>which were
only one thickness of boards.&nbsp; There were sixty such little
rooms, not luxuriously furnished, for at the first day&rsquo;s
sale of the contents of the barracks, on the 18th September 1816,
twenty-seven lots of the officers&rsquo; furniture, consisting of
six Windsor chairs and one deal table, realised for each lot from
9<i>s.</i> to 32<i>s.</i>; for twenty-six lots, each comprising
one table and two chairs, the price varied from 2<i>s.</i> to
17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; while for sixty lots, consisting of one
officer&rsquo;s shovel, poker, tongs, fender and bellows, the
price per lot varied from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The bellows in each room suggest that the fuel
supplied was the peat from the adjoining fens, which was usually
burned in the district, and which, although it warmed the
thatched cottage with thick walls, would give poor comfort to the
shivering officer with only a board between him and the outer
air.</p>
<p>The account of the Depot is incomplete without the mention of
a detached field, situated a few hundred yards north of the site
of the prison, on the opposite, that is the west, side of the
Great North Road.&nbsp; Shortly after the prison was occupied,
the lower part of this field was purchased by the Government for
a burial place for the prisoners, and was resold in 1816.&nbsp;
To it, during the occupation of the Depot, were carried across
the bodies of some 1,750 prisoners, whose fate it was to die
within the prison walls.&nbsp; There is nothing now to
distinguish this prison cemetery, except the mounds, called by
the inhabitants of the district &ldquo;The Lows&rdquo;; it will
be dealt with in a further chapter.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that the buildings which have been
described were originally only intended to be of a temporary
character, and that from various causes detailed in the report
given in the Appendix, certain portions of the woodwork had
perished during the seventeen years of the Depot&rsquo;s
existence before the date <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>of that report.&nbsp; That document
also shows that there was occasional &ldquo;scamping&rdquo; by
those employed in the work required to maintain the
fabrics.&nbsp; The general excellence and durability of the
materials are however proved by the fact that even now, at the
end of a century, portions of them are still serving the purposes
of cottages, workshops, or farm buildings in the neighbouring
towns and villages to which they were transported at the sale in
1816.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Examples in Peterborough include the portion of a casern,
already alluded to as purchased by Mr. Ruddle and re-erected at
his works&mdash;it still forms part of a carpenters&rsquo; shop
in the extensive works of the firm of John Thompson, contractors,
so famous as cathedral restorers; a group of tenements known as
Barrack Yard; and two cottages, the latter being one of the
turnkeys&rsquo; lodges reconstructed.&nbsp; These cottages are
still inhabited, but are clearly destined to be very shortly
improved off the face of the earth.&nbsp; That they were in old
days vulgarly called &ldquo;Bug Hall&rdquo; gives a hint as to
one minor discomfort which the densely packed French prisoners
endured in these wooden buildings.&nbsp; Such was the Depot,
which term included the prison, with its various necessary
adjuncts, official residences, offices, etc., and the military
barracks, complete for a force of two infantry regiments, with
hospital, a sutling-house and canteens, the two latter let to
contractors at rents respectively of &pound;12 and &pound;10
16<i>s.</i> a month, bringing into the Government the sum of
&pound;270 6<i>s.</i> a year.&nbsp; The Depot was unfortunately
under a divided control, the barrack master-general was
responsible for the buildings and a barrack master appointed by
him resided in a detached house at the Depot.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Transport Office&rdquo; was responsible for the management
of the prisoners of war at home and abroad.&nbsp; The
responsibility of the Transport Commissioners included the
arrangements for the feeding and <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the discipline of the
prisoners.&nbsp; The details were left to their representative
agent, who also resided in the Depot. <a
name="citation38a"></a><a href="#footnote38a"
class="citation">[38a]</a></p>
<p>The military commander, the brigade-major, of course had
control of the troops (usually two Militia regiments) quartered
in the barracks, east and west of the prison. <a
name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b"
class="citation">[38b]</a></p>
<p>As the first portion of the buildings approached completion,
it became necessary to make provision beforehand for the
reception and maintenance of the prisoners waiting to occupy it,
and from the buildings attention must now be directed to the
officials and the organisation of the Depot.&nbsp; To each Depot
in the country an agent was appointed, who was at every other
prison a post captain in the Royal Navy on full pay; but at
Norman Cross in the first instance a departure from this rule was
made.&nbsp; The following extracts from a letter written by the
Transport Board to Mr. Delafons on his appointment to the office
are of interest as throwing light on the nature of his
duties.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Transport Office</span>,<br />
&ldquo;18th March 1797.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>To</i> John Delafons, Esq.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We direct you to proceed without delay to the prison at
Norman Cross, to which you are appointed Agent, and report to us
the present state thereof, as well as the time when in your
judgement it will be ready for the reception of prisoners of
War.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have ordered bedding for six thousand prisoners to
be sent to Norman Cross as soon as possible, and we expect it
will arrive there before the end of this month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you are provided with a list of such articles and
utensils as will be necessary for carrying on the service, we
direct you to make enquiry at Peterborough respecting the terms
on which those articles may be procured at that place; and you
are to transmit to us a list of such of them as you may think are
to be obtained at more reasonable rates, or of a better quality
in London.&nbsp; We have appointed Mr. Dent, now one of the
clerks at Porchester Castle, to be your first Clerk and
Interpreter, with a salary of &pound;80 per annum, and have
directed him to proceed forthwith to Norman Cross.&nbsp; We have
appointed Michael Brien as one of the Stewards in consequence of
your recommendation.&nbsp; A supply of printed Forms will be sent
to you from this Office, and you are to be allowed ten guineas
per annum for the stationery.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter went on to authorise the agent to procure tin
mess-cans, wooden bowls, platters, and spoons for 3,000 prisoners
at Wisbeck [<i>sic</i>] and Lynn, and to inform him that 1,000
hammocks, 1,000 palliasses, 1,000 bolster-cases, also 5,000 sets
of bedding, were on their way from London, and that the prisoners
from Falmouth <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>would bring their own hammocks with them. <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"

<p>These stores, it must be borne in mind, were only for the use
of the occupants of that portion of the prison which was
complete, about one fourth of the whole.</p>
<p>Mr. Delafons does not appear to have taken up the duties
assigned to him, for on the 26th March, only eight days after the
date of the letter appointing him agent, he sent in his formal
resignation.&nbsp; Mr. Dent, the storekeeper, in conjunction with
Captain Woodriff, the transport officer, acted till the
appointment of James Perrot on 7th April 1797, at a salary of
&pound;400 a year and &pound;30 for house rent, until quarters
could be built for him in the prison.&nbsp; This amount was
double that of any other agent, but it must be remembered that
Mr. Perrot was not a naval officer in receipt of full pay.&nbsp;
There was a difficulty in finding lodgings in the vicinity, and
the clerks were allowed 1<i>s.</i> a day extra till accommodation
could be found for them also at the prison.</p>
<p>To assist the agent, Mr. Challoner Dent was appointed
storekeeper from 1st April 1797 on getting two gentlemen as
security for &pound;1,000.&nbsp; There were clerks and ten
turnkeys, twelve labourers at 12<i>s.</i> a week, and a
lamplighter at 13<i>s.</i> a week.&nbsp; The chief clerk and
Dutch interpreter was Mr. James Richards.</p>
<p>The transport officer in charge, Captain Woodriff, <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>had to make
arrangements for the conveyance of the expected prisoners to
Norman Cross, and for the victualling.&nbsp; As to the former, he
was on the 23rd March directed without loss of time to proceed to
Norman Cross near Stilton, and thence to Lynn to report as to the
best anchorage there, and the best mode of transporting the
prisoners of war expected.&nbsp; He was to consult a Mr. Hadley,
who proposed 1<i>s.</i> a head for removing the prisoners, which
was considered exorbitant and quite out of the question.</p>
<p>On 29th March, however, he was directed to enter into an
agreement with Mr. Kempt, to convey the prisoners from Lynn to
Yaxley at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per head, and Kempt&rsquo;s
partner was to victual them on the following daily ration: 1 lb.
of bread or biscuit, &frac34; lb. of good fresh or salt beef.</p>
<p>The time occupied by the barges in which the men were to be
conveyed would probably be about three days, and the dietary
could not be much varied.&nbsp; At the date when this contract
was made, nearly fifty years before the first railway in this
district was opened, the waterways offered the easiest and
cheapest channel for the transport of heavy goods across the
great Fen district.&nbsp; The rivers, natural and artificial, and
the navigable drains and cuts, fulfilled a double purpose, and
were maintained by taxes and tolls not only for the drainage of
the Fens, but as waterways for the lucrative traffic which was
constant along their surface.</p>
<p>It was by water that George Borrow and his mother travelled to
join his father in his quarters at Norman Cross, and we have
again a graphic account of the impressions left on the
child&rsquo;s mind by the journey from Lynn to Peterborough when
the washes and Fenlands were flooded&mdash;an account written
long after the child had come to man&rsquo;s estate, when
distance had lent enchantment to the view and certainly depth to
the pools on the towing paths.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>&ldquo;At length my father was recalled to his regiment,
which at that time was stationed at a place called Norman Cross,
in Lincolnshire, or rather Huntingdonshire, at some distance from
the old town of Peterborough.&nbsp; For this place he departed,
leaving my mother and myself to follow in a few days.&nbsp; Our
journey was a singular one.&nbsp; On the second day we reached a
marshy and fenny country, which owing to immense quantities of
rain which had lately fallen, was completely submerged.&nbsp; At
a large town we got on board a kind of passage-boat, crowded with
people; it had neither sails nor oars, and these were not the
days of steam-vessels; it was a treck-schuyt, and was drawn by
horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young as I was, there was much connected with this
journey which highly surprised me, and which brought to my
remembrance particular scenes described in the book which I now
generally carried in my bosom.&nbsp; The country was, as I have
already said, submerged&mdash;entirely drowned&mdash;no land was
visible; the trees were growing bolt upright in the flood, whilst
farmhouses and cottages were standing insulated; the horses which
drew us were up to the knees in water, and, on coming to blind
pools and &lsquo;greedy depths,&rsquo; were not unfrequently
swimming, in which case the boys or urchins who mounted them
sometimes stood, sometimes knelt, upon the saddle and
pillions.&nbsp; No accident, however, occurred either to the
quadrupeds or bipeds, who appeared respectively to be quite <i>au
fait</i> in their business, and extricated themselves with the
greatest ease from places in which Pharaoh and all his host would
have gone to the bottom.&nbsp; Nightfall brought us to
Peterborough, and from thence we were not slow in reaching the
place of our destination.&rdquo; <a name="citation42"></a><a

</blockquote>
<p>A Mr. James Hay of Liverpool was the first contractor for
victualling the prisoners at Norman Cross, <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>the
specification for the quality of the food supplied being as
follows:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>Beer, to be equal quality to that supplied to H.M.
ships.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Bread, to be made of wheaten flour, equal to what is known
by bakers as thirds, to be baked into loaves of 4&frac12; lb.,
each to be weighed 6 hours after baking.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Beef, to be good and wholesome and fresh and delivered in
clean quarters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Butter, to be good salt.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Cheese, to be good Gloucester, or Wiltshire, or of equal
goodness.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Peas, to be of the white sort, and good boilers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Greens, to be stripped of their outside leaves and fit for
the copper.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The reader must bear these conditions in mind if he would be
in a position to discount George Borrow&rsquo;s description (in
the passage quoted a few pages back) of the food supplied to
those prisoners whom he remembered with such sympathy in his
later life; and he must, in forming his judgment of the treatment
accorded to the prisoners, remember that, as evidence, the stern
facts of a contract, with penalties of fine and imprisonment for
its breach, are of more value than the recollections of a child,
given in the rhetorical language of a romantic enthusiast.</p>
<p>The victualling under the terms of the contract commenced on
the 12th April 1797.&nbsp; The contractor was called upon to
supply per head daily, 1 lb. of beef, 1 lb. of biscuit, 2 quarts
of beer, and to find casks and water at 11<i>d.</i> per day,
being the same terms as those on which the goods were supplied at
Plymouth and Falmouth.&nbsp; Mr. Hay wrote that no butcher within
fifty miles of Norman Cross would supply cow, heifer, <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>or ox beef
for less than 44<i>s.</i> per cwt., but he offered to supply it
at 43<i>s.</i>, and this was agreed to. <a
name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a></p>
<p>No tables or benches were to be provided.&nbsp; Hammocks were
supplied, but no clews nor lanyards (the cords to suspend them
by); these the prisoners had to make for themselves, jute being
supplied to them for that purpose, one ton to every 400 men.</p>
<p>The new agent, Mr. Perrot, who came from the prison at
Porchester Castle, appears to have applied for other comforts, as
we infer from the following communication addressed to him from
the Transport Office:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We cannot allow any razors or strops for
the use of the prisoners at Norman Cross.&nbsp; We see no reason
for your appointing barbers, to shave the prisoners, the razors
sent to Porchester having been intended more for shaving the
Negro prisoners from the West Indies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does the fact that the names of the two first agents
appointed, Delafons and Perrot, were French, and that they were
not naval officers as at other prisons, justify the supposition
that our Government in their anxiety to study the interests of
the prisoners and to satisfy the French, were trying the
experiment of appointing a British subject of French birth or of
French origin as agent to this Depot?&nbsp; Such a supposition
might account for the fact of Mr. Delafons&rsquo; resignation a
few days after his appointment.&nbsp; A man in sympathy with <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>the French
might well find, on entering into the particulars of his duties,
that he could not conform to the regulations regarded by the
Government as necessary for the discipline of
prisons&mdash;regulations, for breaking which, many prisoners
lost their lives.&nbsp; Does not this letter to Mr. Perrot also
read as though he were making a frivolous application to the
Government?</p>
<p>Whatever the worth of this supposition may be, we find that on
the 2nd January 1799, less than two years after his appointment,
Mr. Perrot&rsquo;s name disappears from the books, and that
Captain Woodriff, R.N., the transport officer who had been acting
for the transport office in the district, was asked to take over
the duties of the agent, receiving a small addition to his
previous salary.</p>
<p>The duties of the Depot agent and the district agent must have
previously overlapped, for it was Captain Woodriff, the Transport
officer, who two years before was making all the arrangements for
the reception and maintenance of the prisoners, and who shortly
after their arrival, having employed some of them to spread the
gravel in the exercise yards, paying them 3<i>d.</i> a day for
doing it, was called upon by the Government to furnish the
information as to the wages and the prices of provisions in the
neighbourhood, given in the extract from his report printed in
the footnote on p. 16.</p>
<p>Captain Woodriff held the post of agent at Norman Cross from
his appointment in 1799 to the Peace of Amiens in 1802, having
previously from 2nd September 1796, when he was appointed agent
of the Transport Office at Southampton, been engaged in duties
associated with the care of prisoners of war.&nbsp; In July 1808
he was appointed agent for prisoners of war at Forton, holding
office until 1813.&nbsp; He thus spent, in all, eleven years of
his long services as a naval officer, assisting the Transport
Board in their important work as the custodian <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>of the
prisoners.&nbsp; In the Appendix will he found a short biography
of Captain Woodriff, collated by Mr. Rhodes.&nbsp; It gives an
insight into the adventurous and uncertain career which, during
the epoch with which this history has to do, might be that of a
naval officer of distinction, and shows that the custodian of the
prisoners at Norman Cross and Forton was himself at one time an
English prisoner at Verdun. <a name="citation46"></a><a
href="#footnote46" class="citation">[46]</a></p>
<p>On the 24th March the troops who were to form the garrison had
marched into their quarters, this event being noted in his diary
by John Lamb, a farmer and miller living at Whittlesey, about
seven miles from Norman Cross&mdash;&ldquo;24th March 1797 the
soldiers came to guard the Barracks.&nbsp; The Volunteers did not
much like it; they liked drinking better.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
arrangements being sufficiently advanced, the prisoners sent from
Falmouth, who for several days had been waiting, cooped up in the
Transports at Lynn, were disembarked and put into lighters, to be
brought by water to Yaxley and Peterborough, and the first
prisoners passed through the prison gates on 7th April 1797, just
four months from the commencement of the building.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have now arrived at that stage
in the story of the Norman Cross Depot when, although the whole
of the buildings were not yet erected, sufficient progress had
been made for the occupation of a part of them.&nbsp; Two
quadrangles were ready, each of them containing caserns and the
necessary accessory buildings for the care and safe custody of
2,000 men.&nbsp; The other two quadrangles were rapidly
approaching completion, one for 2,000 prisoners, the other, the
north-eastern block, for a smaller number, as it was in part
devoted to the accommodation of the sick, who slept in bedsteads
instead of in hammocks, and therefore occupied a far greater
space than the healthy men.</p>
<p>In this north-eastern square each casern was artificially
warmed by fires, and in every extant plan these blocks are shown
to have chimneys, while all the others have merely
ventilators.&nbsp; The buildings were cut up by partition walls
into wards, and surgeons&rsquo; and attendants&rsquo; rooms,
which further interfered with their capacity; but,
notwithstanding the limited number of the occupants <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>of this
quadrangle, it is probable that in the most crowded period of its
occupation the prison held, including the sick, and the occupants
of the boys&rsquo; prison outside the boundary wall, at least
7,000 prisoners.</p>
<p>On the 10th April 1810 a return made of all the prisoners of
war in England on that day shows 6,272 at Norman Cross.&nbsp;
These returns are few and far between, and may well have missed a
period of overcrowding; the lowest of any of them, one rendered
in 1799, gives the number as 3,278.</p>
<p>To appreciate the details of the life of the prisoners, the
reader must grasp the magnitude of the experiment which was being
initiated at this Depot, where a number of men, equal to the
adult male population of a town of 30,000 inhabitants, were to be
confined within four walls, with no society but that of their
fellow prisoners, no female element, no intercourse with the
outside world, except that in the prison market, in which they
were served by foreigners, whose language they did not
understand.&nbsp; In this community order and discipline had to
be maintained, while at the same time ordinary humanity demanded
that these unfortunate men, who had committed no crime, who were
in a foreign prison for doing their duty and fighting their
country&rsquo;s enemies, must be treated with all possible
leniency.</p>
<p>The exigencies of the war, and the circumstances under which
many of the men arrived at the prison, were not conducive to
peace and order, and the posts of agent of the Depot and of
transport officer carried great responsibility.&nbsp; This we can
realise from an occurrence, a vivid example of the horrors of
war, concerning which Captain Woodriff had to hold an inquiry as
one of his first duties in connection with the Depot.&nbsp; Among
the thousand prisoners who, when the prison was opened, were
already on their way to Norman Cross from Portsmouth, Falmouth,
Kinsale, and Chatham, were men <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>who had been conveyed on board the
<i>Marquis of Carmarthen</i> transport, on which ship there had
been a mutiny of the prisoners.&nbsp; In the fray seven men were
killed and thirty-seven dangerously wounded, but the mutiny was
quelled and all the prisoners accounted for, except one, who was
the murderer of one of the crew.&nbsp; Next day he was discovered
and placed in irons, with a sentry over him.&nbsp; He asked to be
shot, and in the absence of the captain of the vessel, who
protested against his wish being acceded to, the officer
commanding the troops, one Lieutenant Peter Ennis of the
Caithness Militia, shot the unfortunate man, and had the body
thrown overboard.&nbsp; This happened three days after the
mutiny.&nbsp; The matter was investigated and reported upon by
Captain Woodriff at Norman Cross.&nbsp; The prisoners gave
evidence that they had mutinied on account of the badness of the
water and provisions, and complained that Inglis, or Ennis, was
brutal to them. <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a>&nbsp; The same causes were assigned for
another mutiny on the <i>British Queen</i> transport, which had
to be reported upon by the agent at Norman Cross.&nbsp; To quell
this outbreak, the mutineers were fired on by the captain&rsquo;s
orders, twelve being wounded, but none killed.</p>
<p>The earliest arrivals on the 7th April 1797 were the sailors
from the frigate <i>R&eacute;union</i> and 172 from the
<i>R&eacute;volutionnaire</i> man-of-war, which had been brought
in by <i>The Saucy Arethusa</i>.&nbsp; These were brought by
water to Yaxley.&nbsp; The next batch arrived on the 10th, and
were landed from the barges at Peterborough, proceeding to Norman
Cross guarded by troopers.</p>
<p>The latter detachment was landed, according to Mr.
Lamb&rsquo;s diary, at Mr. Squire&rsquo;s close on the south bank
of the river at Peterborough.&nbsp; This Mr. Squire was <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>later
appointed the agent to look after the prisoners on parole in
Peterborough and its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Other prisoners followed in rapid succession, their names,
with certain particulars, being entered in the French and the
Dutch registers, which were kept at the prison.&nbsp; The French
registers number six large volumes, ruled in close vertical
columns, which extend across the two open pages.&nbsp; The first
column, commencing at the left-hand margin, is for the numbers
(the current number), which run consecutively to the end of the
series; the second is headed, &ldquo;Where and how taken&rdquo;;
the third, &ldquo;When taken&rdquo;; fourth, &ldquo;Name of
vessel&rdquo;; fifth, &ldquo;Description of vessel,&rdquo; such
as Man-of-War, Privateer, Fishing Vessel, Greenlander; sixth,
&ldquo;Name of prisoner&rdquo;; seventh, &ldquo;Rank&rdquo;;
eighth, &ldquo;Date of reception at the prison&rdquo;; ninth, a
column of letters which signify D, &ldquo;discharged,&rdquo; E,
&ldquo;escaped,&rdquo; etc., and the date of discharge.&nbsp; The
Dutch register is in five volumes only, but the entries are
fuller than those in the French register, there being thirteen
columns across the two pages.&nbsp; The first, the &ldquo;Current
number&rdquo;; second, &ldquo;Number in general entry
book&rdquo;; third, &ldquo;Quality&rdquo; (sailor, drummer,
gunner, mate, etc.); fifth, &ldquo;Ship&rdquo;; sixth,
&ldquo;Age&rdquo;; seventh, &ldquo;Height&rdquo; (range from 4
ft. 11&frac12; in. to 5 ft. 10&frac12; in.); eighth,
&ldquo;Hair&rdquo; (all brown); ninth, &ldquo;Eyes&rdquo; (the
majority blue, some brown and a few grey); tenth,
&ldquo;Visage&rdquo; (as round and dark, oval and ruddy);
eleventh, &ldquo;Person&rdquo; (middle size, rather stout);
twelfth, &ldquo;Marks or wounds&rdquo; (e.g.&nbsp;
None&mdash;Pitted with small-pox&mdash;Has a continual motion
with his eyes); thirteenth, &ldquo;When and how discharged&rdquo;
(Dead; Exchanged; etc.). <a name="citation50"></a><a
href="#footnote50" class="citation">[50]</a></p>
<p>In both registers there are occasional marginal notes.&nbsp; A
few examples of the value of these registers as sources <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>of
information will suffice for this history.&nbsp; Commencing with
the French, we find that 190 French soldiers, captured on 7th
January 1797 in <i>La Ville de L&rsquo;Orient</i>, were received
into custody 26th April 1797.&nbsp; Of these, the first one
recorded as dead was a soldier Jacques Glangetoy, on the 9th
February 1798.&nbsp; Of ninety-four captured on 31st December
1796 on <i>La Tartuffe</i> frigate, many are only entered by
their Christian names, as F&eacute;lix, Hilaire, Eloy, Guillaume,
etc.&nbsp; On 11th October 1799 there came a batch from
Edinburgh, captured 12th October 1798 in <i>La Coquille</i>
frigate, off the Irish Coast.&nbsp; On the 28th July 1800 the
garrison of Pondicherry, captured 23rd August 1793, were, after
seven years of captivity at Chatham, transferred to Norman
Cross.&nbsp; On the 6th October of the same year, 1,800 prisoners
captured at Goree, and other places in the West Indies, were
transferred from Porchester.</p>
<p>From the Dutch register we gather that it was the Dutch
prisoners who filled the prison to overflowing a few months after
it was opened.&nbsp; The great naval battle already alluded to as
imminent when the prison was building, took place on 11th October
1797, off Camperdown, when Admiral Duncan, after a severe
engagement, defeated the Dutch fleet under Admiral de Winter,
capturing the <i>Cerberus</i>, 68 guns; <i>Jupiter</i>, 74;
<i>Harleem</i>, 68; <i>Wassenaar</i>, 61; <i>Gelgkheld</i>, 68;
<i>Vryheid</i>, 74; <i>Delft</i>, 56; <i>Alkmaar</i>, 56; and
<i>Munnikemdam</i>, 44.&nbsp; The Dutch fought gallantly, and the
ships they surrendered were well battered.</p>
<p>The loss of life was appalling, and the number of Dutch
prisoners brought in by the English Admiral was 4,954, the
majority of these being ultimately sent to Norman Cross, where
they began to arrive in November 1797.&nbsp; The first entry of
prisoners taken in this great battle is a list of 261 from
Admiral Ijirke&rsquo;s ship <i>Admiral de Vries</i>.</p>
<p>Subsequent arrivals were crews of privateers and <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>merchant
ships, fishermen, and soldiers.&nbsp; Entries in later years show
that among the prisoners sent to Norman Cross were many other
civilians besides the fishermen; these were not retained in the
prison, but were allowed out on parole or were released.&nbsp;
Many fishing vessels were captured, the crew averaging six; these
sailors were sent to Norman Cross, and after a few days&rsquo;
confinement were &ldquo;released&rdquo; by the Board&rsquo;s
order.&nbsp; The soldiers were entered in a separate
register.&nbsp; The first batch were taken from the <i>Furie</i>,
captured by the <i>Sirius</i> on the 14th October 1798, they were
received at Norman Cross on the 20th November of the same year,
and are described in the appropriate column as bombardiers,
cannoniers, passengers, etc.&nbsp; To ascertain what was the
ultimate destination of the prisoners, Mr. Rhodes has made an
analysis of the information given in the registers for the
individual members of the crew of selected ships.&nbsp; As to the
first ship to which he applied this method, he found that of the
crew, the quartermaster was exchanged, 7th April 1798, one of the
coopers was allowed to join the British Herring Fishery, the
majority of the officers were allowed on parole at Peterborough,
several seamen joined the British Navy, one was discharged on the
condition he elected to serve under the Prince of Orange, one
enlisted in the York Hussars, and at various dates many enlisted
in the 60th Regiment of Foot.&nbsp; Of the soldiers, the officers
were allowed on parole at Peterborough, some privates joined the
Royal Marines at Chatham, nine joined the 60th Foot, and in 1800
the remainder, with the sailors, were sent to Holland under the
Alkmaar Cartel. <a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a>&nbsp; An analysis of the columns giving
the disposal of the next ship&rsquo;s company shows that nine
were on parole at <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>Peterborough, two were sent to serve under the Prince of
Orange, two joined the British Herring Fishery, seven the British
Navy, two the Merchant Service, four the Dutch Artillery, three
died, ninety-three enlisted in the 60th Foot, and the rest were
sent to Holland.</p>
<p>In explanation of the preponderance of recruits for the 60th
Foot, it may be pointed out that this regiment was originally
raised in America in 1755, under the title of the 62nd Loyal
American Provincials, and consisted principally of German and
Swiss Protestants who had settled in America, the principal
qualification being that they were &ldquo;antagonistic to the
French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1757 the title was changed to the 60th Royal Americans,
which title it bore till 1816.&nbsp; The regiment is now the
King&rsquo;s Royal Rifle Corps.&nbsp; It served in America and
the West Indies up to 1796.&nbsp; It was in England till 1808,
when it went to the Peninsula.&nbsp; At Quebec it was described
by General Wolfe as &ldquo;Celer et Audax,&rdquo; which is now
the regimental motto.</p>
<p>The crew of the <i>Jupiter</i>, with the captain, four
lieutenants, and the Admiral&rsquo;s steward, 144 in all, were
received 8th November 1797, and were ultimately distributed in
much the same manner, fifty entering the 60th.&nbsp; In December,
a month after their reception, the Dutch captain and two
lieutenants of this ship were sent to London to give evidence
against two British subjects who were taken in arms against this
country on board the <i>Jupiter</i> when it was captured.&nbsp;
Coach hire was allowed them, and double the subsistence usually
given to officers on parole.</p>
<p>Of the crew of the privateer <i>Stuyver</i>, numbering
thirty-eight, captured on 1st June 1797 by the <i>Astrea</i>,
eight joined the English Navy.</p>
<p>From the registers we get information as to the length of time
the various crews, etc., remained in captivity.&nbsp; Thus the
crew of the <i>Furie</i>, a Dutch frigate, numbering <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>115, received
at Norman Cross on the 4th October 1798, remained there until the
Peace of Amiens in February 1802; the officers were out on
parole, and the majority of them were released in February 1800,
under the Alkmaar Cartel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the registers are very imperfectly kept; they
are filled in without any regularity; the entries appear to have
been copied from other documents, and there are weeks and months
when column after column is left blank.&nbsp; There is no doubt
that the staff was too limited for the work that was expected of
it.&nbsp; Incomplete and bad clerical work was the result.&nbsp;
The names of several sloops and schooners are duly returned as
&ldquo;Taken,&rdquo; but in the columns &ldquo;By whom and when
taken,&rdquo; is the entry &ldquo;Unknown.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is
an entry of three names bracketed together, probably the crew of
a fishing-boat: &ldquo;Andreas Anderson, 1st Steerman; Johanna
Maria Dorata Anderson, Woman, his wife; Margrita Dorothea
Anderson, child.&nbsp; Received into custody 31st May
1800.&rdquo;&nbsp; On 3rd June they are marked as &ldquo;On
parole at Peterborough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are occasional marginal notes, of which the following is
an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This man was brought in by an escort of the
Anglesea Militia from Peterborough; never been here
before.&mdash;Ideot.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader must decide for himself, without any assistance
from the author, whether the word spelt &ldquo;Ideot&rdquo; was
intended as a description of the <i>supposed escaped
PRISONER</i>, or as that of the officer who had sent him in.</p>
<p>Norman Cross was not one of the prisons to which Americans
were consigned in any numbers, and was not affected by the
positive order against any natives of America being allowed to
enter the British Service, or being exchanged on any account
whatever.&nbsp; The surgeons captured were allowed special
privileges in <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>consideration of their devoting their professional skill
to the service of their fellow prisoners.</p>
<p>The registers are sufficient to indicate the nationality and
the social position of the population of the prison.&nbsp; The
large number of the Dutch who joined the English service shows
that their hatred of imprisonment was stronger than their hatred
of the enemy who had captured them.&nbsp; As to the nationality
of the prisoners, they were in the first period of the war, from
1797 to 1802, almost all French or Dutch; in the second period,
1803 to 1814, they were almost all French, and for those eleven
years, although there were representatives of various
nationalities who had been fighting on the side of the French,
either as allies or actually serving in the French ranks, the
captives were always spoken of in the neighbourhood as the French
prisoners.&nbsp; There were published, in a recent issue of the
<i>Peterborough Advertiser</i>, extracts from newspapers
contemporary with the period of the Norman Cross Depot, the
following paragraph from a newspaper, the name of which is not
given, is included:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;March 25th, 1814, Yarmouth.&nbsp; Yesterday
morning the Dutch Volunteers from Yaxley Barracks, who were
organised, and have been in training here about ten weeks,
embarked in two divisions for the Dutch Coast.&nbsp; They
amounted to over 1,000 men.&nbsp; They were completely armed and
clothed, and made a soldier-like appearance.&nbsp; Their uniform
was blue jackets, faced with red, white trimmings, orange sash,
and white star on the caps.&nbsp; The cry of Orange Bonon, just
after starting from the Jetty, was universal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have found no record of any numbers of Dutch prisoners
being at Norman Cross in this or any other year of the second
period of the war.&nbsp; The great bulk of this contingent, going
out to serve against Napoleon, <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>were probably not Dutch, but men of
various nationalities, who had gained their freedom by
volunteering for service under the allies, who were, on the 25th
March, within five days&rsquo; march of Paris.&nbsp; This Dutch
contingent was doubtless destined to join the army of
Bernadotte.</p>
<p>The consideration of the prison life of our captives at the
close of the eighteenth century will serve to accentuate the
difference between their surroundings, their life, and their
fate, and that of the prisoners taken one hundred years later by
either side in the South African War; and the picture of the
French and Dutch prisoners in the hulks or even in the Depots in
1800, contrasted with that of the Boers in St. Helena and Ceylon
in 1900, must fill us with thankfulness for what the
century&rsquo;s advance inhumanity, together with the altered
conditions in which we live, have enabled us and other nations to
do to mitigate the miseries of prisoners of war&mdash;woes which
have existed from time immemorial, and which are recognised in
the prayer in the Litany, which has been offered up for nearly
two thousand years, invoking God&rsquo;s pity &ldquo;for all
prisoners and captives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1900, steam navigation, telegraphic communication, and
Britain&rsquo;s command of the sea made it possible for her to
place her prisoners <i>hors de combat</i> in islands whence
escape was almost impossible, and where the conditions of life
were comparatively comfortable.&nbsp; In the war in which we were
engaged one hundred years before, there is abundant documentary
evidence to show that, although the conditions of that time made
close confinement within prison walls a cruel necessity,
nevertheless, in the treatment of our captives, the dictates of
humanity were carried out, as far as was possible, without
defeating the main object of our Government&mdash;the termination
of the war with peace, safety, and honour for England.</p>
<p>In December 1795, M. Charretie, who had resided for some time
in England, was appointed the commissary <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>for France to
look after the interests of his countrymen in captivity in this
country, and he still occupied the post sixteen months later,
when the first prisoners arrived at Norman Cross, Mr. Swinburne
being the agent for the British Government in France.</p>
<p>At the time that the Norman Cross Prison was opened, the
French and British Governments were mutually accusing one another
of inhumanity and neglect in the treatment of their captives; the
consideration of the facts which led to these charges must be
left until the internal arrangements of the prison, disciplinary
and economical, have been described.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Excellent</span> organisation was
necessary in order to keep these 6,000 foreign soldiers and
sailors in safe custody, in a good state of discipline, and at
the same time in the best health and greatest comfort compatible
with the circumstances.</p>
<p>To the heads of departments mentioned at the close of the
second chapter should be added the surgeon appointed by the
Government.&nbsp; He was responsible for the sick and wounded, to
a separate department of the Admiralty, and not to the Transport
Board.&nbsp; He lodged in the hospital, until in the early part
of the nineteenth century the house was built for him in the
hospital quadrangle.</p>
<p>The subordinate officials were comparatively few in
number&mdash;clerks, interpreters, storekeepers, stewards, and
turnkeys.&nbsp; These last had sleeping accommodation in their
lodges; the others had lodging money, and slept in the
neighbouring villages, with the exception of the chief clerk and
interpreter, the head storekeeper, the hospital officials, and a
few others.</p>
<p>A few selections from the appointments, which are recorded in
official documents among the thousands of papers which have been
searched by Mr. Rhodes for information, will show the status of
these employ&eacute;s; <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>they are taken from lists referring
to the second period of the war, when the records are more
numerous than before the Peace of Amiens.&nbsp; The officials
enumerated were all in the establishment at Norman Cross when the
prison was finally emptied.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Todd, appointed, 27th June 1803, as
French Interpreter at &pound;30 per annum, was, on 1st July 1813,

<p>For the safe custody of the prisoners, the two regiments of
Militia or Regulars were quartered, one in the Eastern, the other
in the Western Barracks; they furnished strong guards at each
entrance in the prison wall, and cannon were mounted to command
the whole area, while sentries were posted in all directions, and
lamps were numerous to prevent the opportunity of escape in the
darkness.&nbsp; The regiments of the garrison were continually
changed, in order, among other reasons, that the soldiers, who
came in contact with the prisoners when on guard, might not get
too intimate with them, and render them assistance in their
efforts to escape&mdash;or in the illicit trading which will be
described later.&nbsp; For the care of the buildings and the
maintenance of all connected with them, there was the barrack
master and his assistant; the agent, or superintendent, was
responsible to the Transport Board for the care and government of
the prisoners; the care of the sick and wounded devolved upon the
surgeon, who was assisted by French surgeons appointed from those
who had been taken prisoners, the nurses being also men selected
from the prisoners, who were paid for their services.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>Discipline was maintained in accordance with the
following code of regulations laid down for all prisons of
war.&nbsp; Those specially affecting the prisoners were posted up
in order that they might be familiar with them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By the Commissioners for Conducting His
Majesty&rsquo;s Transport Service, and for the Care and Custody
of Prisoners of War.&nbsp; Rules to be observed by the Prisoners
of War in Great Britain, Ireland, &amp;c.:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; The Agent&rsquo;s Orders are to be strictly
obeyed by all the Prisoners; and it is expressly forbidden, that
any Prisoners should insult, threaten, illtreat, and much less
strike the Turnkeys, or any other Person who may be appointed by
the Agent to superintend the Police of the Prison, under Pain of
losing Turn of Exchange, of being closely confined, and deprived
of half their Ration of Provisions, for such time as the
Commissioner may direct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; All the Prisoners are to answer to their Names
when mustered, and to point out to the Agent any Errors they may
discover in the Lists, with which he may be furnished, in order
to prevent the Confusion which might result from erroneous Names:
and such Prisoners as shall refuse to comply with this
regulation, shall be put on Half Allowance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; Should any damage be done to the Buildings by
the Prisoners, either through their endeavouring to escape, or
otherwise, the expense of repairing the same shall be made good
by a Reduction of the Rations of Provisions of such as may have
been concerned; and should the Aggressors not be discovered, all
the Prisoners confined in the particular Building so damaged,
shall contribute by a similar Reduction of their Rations towards
the expense of the said Repairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; Such Prisoners as shall escape from Prison,
and be re-taken, shall be put into the Black Hole, and kept on
Half Allowance, until the expenses occasioned by <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>their Escape
are made good; and they shall moreover lose their Turn of
Exchange, and all Officers of the Navy or Army so offending
shall, from that time, be considered and treated in all respects
as common men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; Fighting, quarrelling, or exciting the least
Disorder is strictly forbidden, under Pain of a Punishment
proportionate to the Offence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6.&nbsp; The Prisons are to be kept clean by the
Prisoners in Turns, and every Person who shall refuse to do that
Duty in his Turn, after having received Notice of the same, shall
be deprived of his Rations, until he shall have complied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;7.&nbsp; The Prisoners are from Time to Time to inform
the Agent of the Clothing or other Articles which they may stand
in need of, and have Money to purchase; and the Agent shall not
only permit them to purchase such Articles, but also take care
that they are not imposed on in the Price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;8.&nbsp; The Prisoners in each Prison are to appoint
Three or Five, from among their own number, as a Committee for
examining the Quality of the Provisions supplied by the
Contractor; for seeing that their full Rations, as to Weight and
Measure, are conformable to the Scheme of Victualling at the Foot
hereof: and if there should be any cause of Complaint they are to
inform the Agent thereof; and should he find the Complaint
well-founded, he is immediately to remedy the same.&nbsp; If the
Agent should neglect this part of his Duty, the Prisoners are to
give information thereof to the Commissioners, who will not fail
to do them justice in every respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;9.&nbsp; All Dealers (excepting such as Trade in
Articles not proper to be admitted into the Prison) are to be
allowed to remain at the principal Gate of the Prison from six
o&rsquo;clock in the morning until three in the Afternoon, to
dispose of the Merchandize to the Prisoners; but any of the
Prisoners who shall be detected in attempting to introduce into
the Prison Spirituous Liquors, or <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>other improper Articles, or in
receiving or delivering any Letter, shall be punished for the
Abuse of this Indulgence, in such Manner as the Commissioners may
direct.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The punishments inflicted for breach of the regulations and
for other offences, were:</p>
<blockquote><p>1st.&nbsp; Reducing the ration of the offender,
and should his messmates condone his offence, the rations of the
whole mess of twelve men, to which he belonged, were
reduced.&nbsp; Thus it became the interest of the whole mess to
prevent any breach of discipline or misconduct by a member.&nbsp;
If a whole mess were insubordinate, and the larger body into
which the messes were grouped condoned the offence, the penalty
was extended to them.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; A more severe punishment was depriving a man of his
chance of exchange by putting him at the bottom of the list; this
was a fearful sentence, for although the actual chance of
exchange was small, each man was daily longing and hoping for the
arrival of the day when his cartel should come.</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; Imprisonment in the Black Hole, a veritable abode
of misery, where solitude was added to the ills of imprisonment,
was the penalty for serious offences, such as assaults on the
staff, violent assaults on other prisoners, attempts to escape,
and more heinous offences.</p>
<p>4th.&nbsp; Incorrigible prisoners, and those guilty of crimes
which were considered as warranting even more severe punishment
than imprisonment, in the Black Hole, were removed to the hulks,
where, in addition to the discomfort of the crowded ships, they
suffered all the other hardships experienced at that date by all
criminals imprisoned in a gaol civil or military.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case of heinous offences and obdurate insubordination,
these punishments were combined&mdash;a man might not only be put
into the Black Hole, but also be put on to reduced rations.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Closing
the market at the east gate of the prison, either against the
whole body of the prisoners or against those of one only of the
four courts, was a punishment inflicted for some general
malpractice, or in order to compel their fellow prisoners to
disclose the names of some miscreants among them.</p>
<p>No record exists of those who were sentenced to confinement in
the Black Hole at Norman Cross, but to show the character of the
delinquencies for which this punishment was inflicted, we quote
from Basil Thomson&rsquo;s <i>Story of Dartmoor Prison</i> <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a> the following selections from the
records of the &ldquo;Cachot&rdquo; at that Depot:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1812</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>February</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Louis Constant and

<p>&ldquo;<i>November</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;N. Moulle and B.
Saluberry, for having daggers concealed on their
persons.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cachot records for March and April, 1813, are even more
significant:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>March</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;P.
Boissard, for striking a turnkey and threatening to murder him on
the first opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>March</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;F. Bilat, for striking
a prisoner named B. Marie, who died shortly afterwards, and
taking away his provisions by force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>March</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;J. Beauclere, for
threatening to stab Mr. Moore, because he could not procure
employment for him on the Buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>April</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;F. Le Jeune, for being
one of the principal provision buyers in the prison, and for
repeatedly writing blood-thirsty and threatening
letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>April</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;M. Girandi and A.
Moine, for being guilty of infamous vices.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For offences against the laws of the land, more grave than
those which could be dealt with by the authorities of the various
depots, the prisoners, like British subjects, were liable to be
tried at the assizes&mdash;thus Nicholas Deschamps and Jean
Roubillard were tried at Huntingdon Assizes for forging &pound;1
bank-notes (which they had <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>done most skilfully).&nbsp; This was
at that time a capital offence, and they were sentenced to death,
but were respited during His Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure, and
remained in Huntingdon Gaol under sentence of death for nine
terrible years, until Buonaparte was sent to Elba in 1814; they
were then pardoned, and sent back to France with the rest of the
liberated prisoners.</p>
<p>On the 9th September 1808, Charles Fran&ccedil;ois Marie
Bourchier, who had been convicted at Huntingdon Assizes of
having, in an attempt to escape, stabbed Alexander Halliday with
a knife, was hanged at the prison in the sight of the whole
garrison, who were under arms, and of all the prisoners.&nbsp;
This is the only recorded civil execution at Norman Cross; there
are several recorded instances of summary military justice,
prisoners being shot dead in attempts to escape.&nbsp; It must be
borne in mind that the prisoners were still our foes, who would,
if they could escape, be at once in the ranks of the
enemy&rsquo;s army fighting against us; and to prevent their
escape, there was, at Norman Cross, little beyond the muskets and
bayonets of the Norman Cross sentries&mdash;sixty of them posted
round and about the prison.</p>
<p>The cleanliness, sanitary and domestic, of the prison, the
inhabitants of which averaged probably about 5,500 men (6,270
being the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official
document as confined in Norman Cross on a specified day), was
provided for by systematic fatigue parties from the prisoners
themselves, one out of each mess of twelve being told off in
regular rotation for the duty of sweeping, washing, scraping, and
disinfecting the prisons; probably under this system the prison
and courts were kept as clean as a man-of-war.&nbsp; Each man on
leaving his hammock, doubled it over so that both clews hung on
one hook, leaving the floor space clear.</p>
<p>The prisoners lived in the caserns day and night <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>when the
weather was too bad for them to live out of doors, but in fair
weather they were compelled by the regulations to live outside
&ldquo;in the airing-court&rdquo; from morning to dusk, except
when they were summoned to the casern for their dinner.&nbsp; The
quadrangle is in Foulley&rsquo;s description of his model always
called &ldquo;<i>pr&eacute;</i>,&rdquo; and probably there was
more or less grass on the surface.</p>
<p>Within the stockade fence which enclosed each quadrangle, the
prisoners, about 1,800 in each square, were left to themselves,
no soldiers, no sentries, no <i>free</i> men, except the
turnkeys, whose lodges were, with the cooking-house, storehouses,
&amp;c., in a special court cut off from the airing-court by the
same unclimbable stockade fence.&nbsp; In each compound the
prisoners formed a self-governing community, but all of them
subject to the laws which applied to the whole body&mdash;viz.
the Prison Regulations.</p>
<p>These communities differed from every other community of human
beings (except perhaps the inmates of monasteries) in being
deprived of any participation in the two essential factors on
which the bare existence of every animal race depends&mdash;viz.
the provision of the actual necessaries of life, food and, in the
case of man, clothing, for the preservation of its own
generation; and the reproduction of its kind, to insure a future
generation.&nbsp; The necessaries of individual life were
provided by the Government.</p>
<p>The feeding of the prisoners and the troops in the barracks
was an enormous tax on the resources of the country, greatly as
it must have benefited the agriculturists, and purveyors of
provisions of all kinds in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; A paragraph
in the <i>Times</i> of 14th August 1814, states that &ldquo;about
&pound;300,000 a year was spent by the Government in Stilton,
Yaxley, Peterborough, and neighbourhood in the necessary
provision of stores,&rdquo; and this was not an exaggerated
statement, as a calculation based on the average number of the <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>prisoners and
garrison, the dietary, and the price of provisions, shows that
bread and meat alone would cost more than half the amount named
in the <i>Times</i>. <a name="citation69"></a><a
href="#footnote69" class="citation">[69]</a></p>
<p>The exact ration appears to have varied:</p>
<p>The contract for victualling commenced on 12th April 1797,
when the contractor was called upon to supply beef 1 lb., biscuit
1 lb., beer 2 quarts&mdash;as the daily ration of each
prisoner.</p>
<p>This must have been a temporary ration on the first <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>opening of
the prison.&nbsp; In a later report the following is given as the
scheme of victualling for a week:</p>

<p>The ration for the greater period appears to have been beef
&frac34; lb., bread &frac12; lb., cabbage 1 lb., or a supply of
pease; Wednesdays or Fridays, herrings or cod substituted for the
meat, and a pound of potatoes.</p>
<p>This change of the diet on Wednesday and Friday, made on
account of the religion of the majority of the prisoners, and
also as being more in accordance with their national diet, was
recommended by the agent of the prison; but there was
considerable delay, and some hardship to the prisoners, before
the recommendation was granted.&nbsp; The fish when it reached
the prison must have been several days old, and was no doubt
salted.&nbsp; A new scale later on was fresh beef &frac12; lb.,
bread 1 lb., a quart of soup composed of vegetables and
pease.&nbsp; The terms of the contracts with those supplying the
food were very stringent.&nbsp; The conditions in the first
contract at Norman Cross have already been given at p. 43 in
chap. ii.</p>
<p>When in November 1797 it was agreed by the French and British
Governments that each Government should feed its own countrymen
in the enemy&rsquo;s prisons, and <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>the French took over the feeding of
the prisoners in Britain, they made only a slight change in the
ration to suit it more to French cookery.&nbsp; The daily
allowance per head being, beer 1 qt., beef 8 oz., bread 26 oz.,
cheese 2 oz. or good salt butter &#8531; oz., pease &frac12; pt.,
fresh vegetables 1&frac12; lb.&nbsp; The French also allowed each
prisoner &frac12; lb. of white soap and &frac34; lb. of tobacco
in leaf, per month.</p>
<p>The diet of hospital patients was on a very liberal scale: 1
pt. of tea morning and evening, 16 oz. of white bread, 16 oz. of
beef or mutton, 1 pt. of broth, 16 oz. of greens or good sound
potatoes, and 2 qts. of malt beer, and, in the case of patients
requiring it, beef, fish, fowls, veal, lamb, and eggs might be
substituted.</p>
<p>The diet was investigated by a commissioner sent round to the
various prisons, who reported that, &ldquo;although the amount of
meat would seem scarcely enough to an Englishman, the French, by
their skill in cookery, made such an excellent soup or broth out
of it as to afford ample support for men living without labour,
such as our labouring poor rarely have at any time, but certainly
not during the present scarcity.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same
commissioner in July 1797 recommended that an alteration should
be made in the contracts, so as to insure early delivery,
&ldquo;as the lateness prevents the cookery of the meat as the
French desire, which is by boiling it down for four or five hours
with a strong and excellent broth, after which the meat is good
for but little, and but little regarded by the prisoners.&rdquo;
<a name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a></p>
<p>The food was prepared by cooks chosen from the prisoners
themselves, and paid by the Government.&nbsp; To <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>insure the
good quality and proper quantity of the goods supplied, and to
eliminate the possibility of the storekeepers being bribed by the
contractors to pass inferior goods, the prisoners of each block
were ordered by Clause 8 of the Prison Rules to appoint delegates
to attend when the food and other goods were delivered, and to
see that they were up to the standard specified in the
contract.</p>
<p>There were in the various prisons occasional complaints, and
if they were justified the contractors were punished.&nbsp; In
one instance the defaulting contractor at Plymouth was fined
&pound;300 and imprisoned for six months in the County
Gaol.&nbsp; Beer at one time was supplied to the prisoners by the
Government, and when this allowance ceased, it could, under
certain regulations, be obtained on payment.&nbsp; This beer was
of a <i>very light and cheap quality</i>, as attested by the
books of the Oundle Brewery, but half a gallon a day, given in
the first ration of which we have found a note, is so large an
allowance, even for those bibulous days, that it suggests an
error in the memorandum.&nbsp; Tea and coffee in those days were
the luxuries of the well-to-do only, and were not for prisoners
or for our own poorer countrymen and women.&nbsp; There was no
tea or coffee.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that every possible precaution was taken
to insure that the food supplied by the Government was good, and
sufficient to maintain an average man in good health, and in the
market held in the enclosed space at the east gate, to which the
prisoners had access, those who had money could buy additional
food and luxuries.&nbsp; But although beyond doubt the allowance
of food was sufficient for an average man, there must have been
in those twenty years thousands of men with hearty appetites who
finished their ration hungry and dissatisfied&mdash;and the
sequel will show that there were others who actually died of
starvation, owing to their own vices.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Each
prisoner was allowed a straw palliasse, a bolster, and a blanket
or coverlet, the straw being changed as often as was
necessary.</p>
<p>The British Government never withdrew its contention that it
was the duty of each nation to provide clothing for its subjects
in captivity in the country of its enemy, and maintained that
this had been the practice of France and England in all previous
wars, even in that in which they were engaged up to the Treaty of
Versailles in 1783, only ten years before the outbreak in 1793 of
the war under discussion; but as an act of humanity, when the
French obstinately declined to discharge this duty, the
Government clothed a certain number of the naked in a yellow
suit, a grey or yellow cap, a yellow jacket, a red waistcoat,
yellow trousers, a neckerchief, two shirts, two pairs of
stockings, and one pair of shoes.</p>
<p>In M. Foulley&rsquo;s model the greater number of the
prisoners are represented as clad in this uniform, the
conspicuous colours of which were selected to facilitate the
detection of an escaped prisoner.&nbsp; In the first year of the
occupation of Norman Cross an order was issued to the storekeeper
to supply such prisoners as were destitute of clothing with the
articles enumerated above.</p>
<p>There is every reason to believe that the provisions for the
maintenance of the prisoners were carried out with the utmost
care and fidelity in Norman Cross and all other prisons, but the
complaints of the prisoners gave rise to such prolonged
controversy and serious disagreement between the Governments of
France and England, that a review of the discussion finds an
appropriate place here.&nbsp; The complaints were not confined to
one side only, but there is ample documentary evidence that the
accusations of the French were greatly exaggerated or absolutely
without foundation.&nbsp; Their hatred of the enemy made the
captives suspicious, <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>and illness from natural causes was
attributed to cruelty and ill-treatment. <a
name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a"
class="citation">[74a]</a></p>
<p>The British Government, according to Mr. Dundas, Secretary of
State, on 6th October 1797, attributed many of the complaints to
passion, prejudice, and animosity (quotation by M. Niou in his
letter to Mr. Dundas, 15th February 1799), <a
name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b"
class="citation">[74b]</a> and it is certain that the French
Government would not object to the fact that the statements made
by the French generals, commissaries, and others, whether the
effect was intended or not, undoubtedly increased the anger of
their nation against the English, and thus infused greater
fighting energy into their troops.&nbsp; The words used by
Buonaparte, in his address to his Army on the eve of Waterloo, to
stimulate his troops, have already been quoted.&nbsp; As to his
reference to the hulks, we must bear in mind that, except under
the pressure of the earlier period of the war, when the prison
accommodation was insufficient, and again later on occasions when
the prisoners had accumulated to a larger number than could be
accommodated on land, even though Dartmoor, Perth, and other
smaller prisons had been built, the hulks were the place of
imprisonment for the <i>criminal</i> prisoners of war only, and
that a century since there was no place of confinement for
criminals in which the conditions could entail anything but
misery.</p>
<p>Of the worst miseries endured by the prisoners at Norman Cross
and other depots, the real sources were the vices of the
unfortunate men themselves, especially <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>gambling and usury, <a
name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a> and to the obstinacy of the French
Government in their determination to provide no clothing and
their neglect to fulfil their promises.&nbsp; The evidence that
this accusation of neglect by the French is well founded, is
furnished by M. Charretie, the agent or commissary appointed by
the French Directory to look after the prisoners in England, who
on the 19th November 1797, in a letter to the Minister of Marine
at Paris, after describing the pitiable condition of many of the
prisoners, who were half-naked for the want of clothes,
proceeds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Consolation, Citizen Minister, might be
felt by the unfortunate prisoners, if their want and misery had
not reached their height, and if assistance could reach them in
time to give foundation to their hopes, but, Citizen Minister,
after all that I have said to them, after all that I have had the
honour of writing to you, concerning their horrible situation and
that in which I am myself placed, without resources, at the mercy
of a crowd of creditors, scarcely able to find the means of
providing for my own subsistence, what would you have me say more
when I see you are deceived with respect to the Measures you take
in regard to them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five thousand livres have long since been announced to
me by your office&mdash;you now make mention of sixty thousand
livres, but I have no intelligence of the arrival of the first
farthing of either of these sums.&nbsp; If promises remain
unexecuted with respect to such sacred and necessary objects in a
service which I can no longer continue, when shall I see those
realised which relate to the providing of Funds for the clothing
of Prisoners,&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;and if of about 9,000 confined
at Norman Cross near 3,000, sick for want of clothing and an
increase of diet, are already on the eve of perishing, what will
be the case some time hence?&nbsp; And upon whom will <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>the
responsibility fall for so many thousand victims?&nbsp; My
correspondence will justify me in the eyes of my country.&nbsp;
However expeditious you may be, Citizen Minister, all you can
hope for is to save the remainder, whom strength of constitution
may have kept longer alive&mdash;what then would be the case if
the English Government should order the measure of driving them
all [this must refer to the officers on parole&mdash;T. J. W.]
into horrible prisons, and of reducing the allowance to half
rations, to be put into execution.&rdquo; <a
name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76"
class="citation">[76]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Republic had taken no notice of the propositions of
Britain made on the 6th October 1797, &ldquo;that the prisoners
should be furnished in the countries where they were detained
with clothing, subsistence, and medicines at the expense of the
Government to which they belonged.&rdquo;&nbsp; The British
Government threatened, in order to compel a reply, that they must
put the prisoners on a reduced allowance on 1st December
1797.</p>
<p>M. Charretie&rsquo;s letter <i>may</i> have assisted the
French Government to sanction the proposal of the British
Minister.&nbsp; What it <i>certainly did</i>, by the statement it
contained as to the proportion of sick among, and the general
condition of, the Norman Cross prisoners, was to enrage the
French against the English.&nbsp; The British Government at once
took steps to prove the statement false.&nbsp; On the 15th
December 1797, Mr. James Perrot, the agent for prisoners of war
at Norman Cross, Dr. Higgins, <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>the physician, Mr. James Magennis,
surgeon, and Messieurs Chatelin and Savary, the French assistant
surgeons, deposed on oath that at no time since the opening of
the prison in April had there been more than 5,170 in the prison
at one time, that up to that day fifty-nine only had died in the
hospital, and that on the 19th November (the date of this letter
in which M. Charretie said that out of about 9,000 prisoners near
3,000 were sick) there were only 194 in hospital, in which number
were included twenty-four nurses; the doctors in addition
certified that, &ldquo;The prisoners are visited every morning by
the chief surgeons or their assistants, and that, whether their
disorders are slight or violent, they are admitted into the
hospital,&rdquo; and the French assistant surgeons (themselves
prisoners of war) added, &ldquo;While there, they are treated
with humanity and attention, and provided with everything
necessary for the re-establishment of their health.&rdquo; <a
name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"
class="citation">[77]</a></p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>In
evidence before a commission held on the 2nd April 1798, M.
Charretie explained that he had received the information inserted
in his letter to the Minister of Marine from prisoners confined
at Norman Cross; that he had intended communicating with the
Transport Board, but that soon after writing to the Minister he
had reason to alter his opinion; that he had informed the French
Government that he thought he had been too hasty, especially as
the Transport Board provided him with lists giving him the number
of prisoners in each prison, but, as fresh prisoners were
arriving, he thought the number might have increased from 5,000
to 9,000.&nbsp; This is a fair sample of the French complaints,
and of how little foundation was found for most of them when they
were investigated.&nbsp; The mortality at Norman Cross was
exceptionally high during its first occupation, but the majority
of the earliest prisoners were those who had been removed from
the prisons, the overcrowded and consequent unhealthy condition
of which gave rise to the hurried building of Norman Cross; they
were therefore specially liable to disease, and unfit to
withstand its ravages.&nbsp; The arrangement for maintaining the
prisoners, from the <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>outbreak of the war in 1793 to November 1797, was that
which had been in force in previous wars between the two
nations&mdash;viz. that each nation should provide the captives
detained in its prisons with food sufficient to maintain life and
health, while it clothed its own countrymen in the enemy&rsquo;s
prisons.</p>
<p>To put an end to the complaints and the recriminations
continually renewed on both sides, relative to the treatment of
the prisoners, our Government had in October 1797 proposed the
fresh arrangement &ldquo;that the Prisoners should be furnished,
in the Country where they were detained, with clothing,
subsistence, and medicines at the expense of the Government to
which they belonged.&rdquo;&nbsp; The French Government took no
notice of this communication, not even acknowledging its receipt,
and to enforce its attention to this and other matters connected
with the exchange of prisoners (especially of Sir Sidney Smith),
the British Government threatened to confine all the officers out
on parole, and to reduce the prison ration, which was at that
time equal to that of a British soldier, to half&mdash;viz. 1 lb.
bread, &frac12; lb. beef, &frac14; lb. pease, and &frac12; lb.
cabbage.</p>
<p>This threat, aided possibly by M. Charretie&rsquo;s
letter&mdash;the piteous appeal of a servant of the Republic
thwarted in the execution of his duties by the neglect of the
Directory to fulfil its promises and to discharge its
responsibilities&mdash;had effect.&nbsp; The new arrangement was
adopted, each nation undertaking to provide food, medicine, and
other necessaries for its own countrymen.&nbsp; While this
arrangement lasted, neither combatant could use the weapon, which
Britain had threatened to employ, the reduction of the ration of
those of the enemy who were captive in its prisons.&nbsp; M.
Gallois, who succeeded M. Charretie as commissary, brought over
M. Nettement, to whom the special task of providing the means of
subsistence for the prisoners was entrusted, the expense being
borne by France.</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>The
contention that the complaints made by the French as to the food,
etc., supplied under the old system, were mostly unfounded, is
supported by the fact that M. Nettement, except in one instance,
employed the same sub-agents, and, in general, the same
contractors, who had been serving the British, and that only
slight modifications in the dietary were made to adapt it more to
French methods of cooking.&nbsp; The new arrangement lasted only
two years; it was terminated abruptly by an Arr&ecirc;t&eacute;
of the French Consuls, dated 29th November 1799 (le Frimaire
l&rsquo;an 8 de la R&eacute;publique une et Indivisible).&nbsp; A
copy of this edict was sent by M. Niou (the Commissary in England
at that date) to Mr. Dundas, Secretary of State for War, with a
letter in which he stated that among other reasons why the
Consuls did not in any manner feel called upon to continue to
observe the arrangement, was the fact &ldquo;that it was not
founded on any authentic stipulation; that the Cartel of
Exchange, signed nearly ten months afterwards, took not the least
notice of it,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>In consequence of this correspondence on the 15th December
1799, the Duke of Portland, acting in the absence of Mr.
Secretary Dundas, communicated to the Admiralty the King&rsquo;s
wishes as to future arrangements.&nbsp; After protesting against
the &ldquo;departure (on the part of the French Government) from
the agreement entered into between the two countries, and which
tended so materially to mitigate the calamities of war,&rdquo; he
directed, as to the British prisoners in France, that Captain
Cotes, the British agent in Paris, should ascertain exactly the
daily allowance made to each man by the French Government, and
that he should, at the expense of the British Government, make up
any deficiency existing between that allowance and the ration
supplied by the British Government during the years 1798 and
1799.&nbsp; At the same time the Minister directed the Transport
Commissioners to supply the French <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>prisoners in Britain, from the date
when the French agent ceased to supply them, with the same
rations of provisions as were granted before the arrangement of
December 1797, and he adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As no mention is made of Clothing or other
necessaries in Captain Cotes&rsquo; letter, I think it right to
add that the Commissioners of Transports and for taking care of
Prisoners of War are on no account to furnish any to the French
Prisoners, as this charge has at all times been supported by the
French Government.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this time to the termination of the war the arrangement
as to the feeding of the prisoners remained the same, but a
terrible source of misery to the French prisoners at Norman
Cross, and to other French prisoners of war in England, was the
firm refusal of the French Government to agree to the clause in
Lord Portland&rsquo;s letter, referring to the clothing of the
prisoners.</p>
<p>In another Edict, dated March 1800, signed by Buonaparte as
First Consul, Article 1, is &ldquo;The Ministers of War and of
the Marine shall ensure by every possible means, subsistence and
clothing to the Russian, Austrian and English Prisoners of
War&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;they shall take care that they are
treated with all Attention and Indulgence consistent with public
safety.&rdquo; <a name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a>&nbsp; The British Government declined
to accept the arrangement implied in this Arr&ecirc;t&eacute;,
and adhered to what had been the uniform custom in the wars
between France and England, and they continued to supply, through
their agent in France, all clothing and similar necessaries to
the British captives, and even to the Russians who had been
serving with them in Holland; while the French, although they
were not called upon to clothe the British, refused,
notwithstanding the miserable state to which their countrymen in
the prisons were reduced by the want of it, to supply them with
any clothing.</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>That
the firmness of the two Governments led to terrible suffering in
the British prisons cannot be doubted&mdash;a suffering which was
not shared by the British in France, who were regularly clothed
by the agent of their own Government; and it has been already
stated that at certain periods of the struggle, including the
latter part of 1797, the British Government did provide, in the
last extremity, clothing for the neglected subjects of their
enemy, protesting, that they did this only as an act of humanity,
and not as a duty.</p>
<p>In looking for the apparent unwillingness of the French to
meet the British on equal terms, we must remember certain
differences in the great principles in which the two nations
conducted war.&nbsp; Alison, commenting on the Peninsular
Campaign, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The British, according to the established
mode of civilised warfare, at least in modern times, maintained
themselves chiefly from magazines in their rear; and when they
were obliged to depend upon the supplies of the provinces where
the war was carried on, they paid for their food as they would
have done in this country.&rdquo; <a name="citation82"></a><a
href="#footnote82" class="citation">[82]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The French, on the other hand, by reverting to the old Roman
system, of making war maintain war, not only felt no additional
burden, but experienced the most sensible relief by their armies
carrying on hostilities in foreign states.&nbsp; From the moment
that his forces entered a hostile territory, it was a fundamental
principle of Napoleon&rsquo;s that they should &ldquo;draw
nothing from the French Exchequer.&rdquo;&nbsp; This principle
applied to the case of the prisoners of war would certainly never
tolerate that France should follow the mode of civilised warfare,
at least in modern times, and should maintain her soldiers
(varying during the war from 20,000 to <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>67,000) incarcerated in Britain if,
by starving them or leaving them naked, she could thrust the
burden of doing so on to the British nation.</p>
<p>The great disparity between the number of the French prisoners
in Britain and the British in France must have strongly
influenced the First Consul to issue the Edict, which cancelled
without ceremony the arrangement in force for the two years
1798&ndash;99.&nbsp; A return made in December 1799, when our
Government again took over the victualling of the French
prisoners, showed their number to be 25,646, of whom 10,128 were
at Portsmouth, 7,477 at Forton (Portsmouth), 3,038 at Norman
Cross, and the rest in Liverpool, Chatham, Stapleton, Edinburgh,
and Yarmouth.&nbsp; The number of English in France was about
5,000.&nbsp; The French therefore, during 1798 and 1799, were
feeding and clothing 25,646, while the British had to feed and
clothe only a little over 5,000.&nbsp; This disparity in the
number of the captives of France and England lasted throughout
the war, and, as will be seen, interfered seriously with the
exchange of prisoners.&nbsp; With the resumption of the old
arrangement, there came again the old complaints; that those of
the British were in some degree justified, is clear from words of
explanation used by the French Commissary, &ldquo;<i>If the
situation of the Finances of the Republic did not allow of the
prisoners receiving the whole of what the law allowed them</i>,
it was not the less true that they experienced in that respect
the benefits of the solicitude of the Government.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The words in italics practically concede the fact that the
British prisoners in France were not receiving what the law
allowed them.</p>
<p>The French never lost sight of the hope, by one means or
another, of getting the prisoners back into the fighting ranks,
and when in answer to a complaint of the French, M. Otto the
commissary had been told &ldquo;That the people here are not
better fed than the prisoners,&rdquo; his retort in writing to
the Transport Commissioners <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>was, &ldquo;If the scarcity of
Provisions is so notorious that the Government [British],
notwithstanding its solicitude, cannot relieve the wants of its
own people, why should it unnecessarily increase the consumption
by feeding more than 22,000 prisoners?&rdquo;&nbsp; M.
Otto&rsquo;s solution of all the difficulties was, send us back
our soldiers and sailors, and cease to burden yourselves with
them.</p>
<p>It may be difficult, even after this long lapse of time, for
either a Frenchman or an Englishman to make an impartial summing
up of a controversy carried on in hot blood and generating bad
feeling which lasted long after Waterloo and the return of the
Bourbons.&nbsp; The British did not shrink from publishing at the
time all the facts and correspondence relating to these
controversial matters, thus enabling their contemporaries of all
nationalities to come to a right judgment and, fortunately for
us, if exaggerated and even lying accusations came from French
sources, their exaggeration and falsehood could usually be proved
by French witnesses.</p>
<p>The piteous letter of M. Charretie has been already quoted as
evidence of where the fault really lay in November 1797.</p>
<p>In 1815 a work was published in Paris called
<i>L&rsquo;Angleterre vue &agrave; Londres et dans ses
Provinces</i>, <i>pendant un s&eacute;jour de dix
ann&eacute;es</i>.&nbsp; An English translation was published in
America in 1818, to the title being added, &ldquo;six of them as
a prisoner of war.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author was Ren&eacute; Martin
Pillet, who, according to his account, was taken prisoner at the
Battle of Vimiera, 1808.&nbsp; He was confined at Norman Cross
and Bishop&rsquo;s Waltham, and at Chatham on the Brunswick
hulk.&nbsp; Space forbids an examination of all his statements
regarding England and English society; his account of the
treatment of prisoners of war alone concerns us.&nbsp; The nature
of his statements can best be understood by the replies
made.&nbsp; There was a pamphlet by some one hailing from
Warrington, <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>issued in 1816, with the title <i>A Defence of our
National Character and our Fair Countrywomen</i>.&nbsp; One
paragraph must suffice:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It has been accurately calculated that not
more than one in ten of the French prisoners died during the last
two wars: if therefore 150,000, as you state, died in the
prison-ships by torture or otherwise, the amount of French
prisoners in these ships must have been 1,500,000, to contain
which it would have required 2,000 ships of the line, but as not
half of the number of prisoners were confined in ships, we must
have taken during the last twenty years double that number,
namely, 3,000,000!&nbsp; Any further comment would be idle and
superfluous.&rdquo; (P. 16.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A detailed examination of Pillet&rsquo;s book was published in
1816, entitled, <i>Tableau de la Grande-Bretagne</i>.&nbsp; The
author was Jean Sarrazin, a very remarkable man.&nbsp; He was
born in 1770, of humble parentage, and served as a private
soldier in the ranks of the French army, but rose very rapidly to
high rank, being General of Brigade in the expedition to Ireland
in 1798, where he was taken prisoner, and, to use his own words,
he was treated as a prisoner of war &ldquo;with the highest
distinction,&rdquo; and was exchanged for the English
Major-General Sir Harry Burral, an ensign, one sergeant, and five
privates.&nbsp; He married an English lady, a native of Exeter,
who returned with him to France.</p>
<p>His brilliant military services under Napoleon, with whom he
was on intimate terms, were varied with literary works of high
value on military subjects.&nbsp; Now comes the stain on his
character.&nbsp; His subsequent career in England proves that he
had a very exaggerated view of his abilities and services, and
when holding a high position in the French army assembled at
Boulogne, he deserted and came over to this country to sell to
the <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>British Government the secrets of the French plan of
campaign.&nbsp; In his absence he was condemned to death.&nbsp;
The nature of his claims on the English Government were
considered extravagant.&nbsp; They comprised:</p>

<p>6.&nbsp; A sum of &pound;50,000 in payment of his notes and
plans (i.e. his treachery).</p>
<p>He also asked to be appointed a Secretary or Aide-de-camp to
Lord Wellington.&nbsp; The Government altogether gave him
&pound;3,000, and he returned to France at the Restoration.&nbsp;
In his book he speaks highly of the English, and defends Captain
Woodriff from the charges of embezzlement.&nbsp; But the most
scathing exposure was by one of high rank and a long
name&mdash;Paul Maximilian Casimir de Quellen de Stuer de
Caussade de la Vauguyon, Prince de Careney.&nbsp; He was a
proscribed Royalist, and his French editor calls him &ldquo;A
Frenchman, as distinguished by birth, as by the nobleness and
independence of his character, and who has thoroughly studied the
country which these writers have feebly pretended to pourtray, is
desirous to evince his gratitude to the generous nation which has
provided him an asylum, at the same time that it has preserved to
the French their King and their Princes.&nbsp; He has thought it
his duty to vindicate the truth which has been wantonly
outraged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following short extracts show his method of dealing with
M. Pillet&rsquo;s accusations:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;When he does not fear to state, that &lsquo;a
hundred and fifty thousand Frenchmen have been killed, in the
midst of tortures,&rsquo; in the British possessions, he states
what is impossible, since the total number of the prisoners of
war did not amount to above one hundred thousand, and more than
eighty thousand Frenchmen were restored to liberty and to their
country after the return of the French King to his dominions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nourishment of the prisoners of war was neither so
scanty nor so inferior in quality as M. Pillet sets forth, a
crowd of Frenchmen, returned from England, attest this.&nbsp; It
is from their authority that we speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The clothing given to the prisoners was of excellent
stuff, many persons in France wear it to this day; and if some
Commissary&rsquo;s wife or clerk did turn a few ells of it to
their own use, is that any reason to accuse the Transport Board
and all England of robbery, per fas et per ne fas?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also deals with the alleged malpractices of Captain
Woodriff, whom Pillet even hints acted with the connivance of the
English Government.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Have we not seen General Warne, at Verdun,
in France, blow his brains out, after having employed the funds,
destined for the English prisoners, to his own private purposes,
because he saw it was impossible to conceal that prevarication,
and to account for his proceedings?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After dealing in detail with many of Pillet&rsquo;s reckless
assertions, he finishes with the following summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;M. Pillet observes a profound silence upon
all these occurrences, yet they are perfectly within his
knowledge, and he himself laboured to <i>organise</i> the general
rising of the prisoners!&nbsp; M. Pillet complains bitterly of
the <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>numberless sufferings which he underwent at Norman Cross
and Bishops Waltham; but he does not mention that he broke his
parole of honour; or that placed on board of a pontoon (hulk),
the consequence of this violation of his parole, some English
Officers consented nevertheless to answer for him, and by them he
obtained a security, although he had forfeited his
parole.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pamphlet&mdash;<i>Aper&ccedil;u du traitement
qu&rsquo;&eacute;prouvent les prisonniers de guerre
fran&ccedil;ais en Angleterre</i> (<i>Lettre &eacute;crite par le
Colonel Lebetre</i>, <i>Paris</i>, 1800)&mdash;has been quoted by
former writers as evidence of the maltreatment by the English,
and on the other hand the assertions have been
contradicted.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the copy of the brochure in
the British Museum was, with some other French pamphlets,
accidentally burned about fifty years ago by a fire in the
book-binders&rsquo; department, and no other copy is
accessible.&nbsp; So that the opinion that Col. Lebetre&rsquo;s
accusations were unjustifiable and self-contradictory can only be
given second-hand.</p>
<p>The evidence which is supposed to establish the charges of
inhuman treatment of their prisoners by the British, including
that of our own countryman George Borrow, breaks down on
examination.&nbsp; But, when in April 1797 the Dutch and French
victims of the war entered the prison at Norman Cross, and
started the community which for nearly twenty years had to carry
on its life under such strange conditions, the place was already
shrouded in this atmosphere of acrimonious contention&mdash;a
stormy and pestilent atmosphere which influenced for evil the lot
of those within its walls.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">PRISON LIFE</p>
<blockquote><p>The worst prisons are not of stone, they are of
throbbing hearts, outraged by an infamous life.&mdash;H. W. <span
class="smcap">Beecher</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is on coming to the
consideration of the life of the captives in their prison that
the want is felt of any contemporary account written by one of
themselves; such accounts are extant for the historian of the
Dartmoor Prison, but for Norman Cross the only sources from which
a description of the prison life can be given, are the meagre
information gleaned from the very few persons who had seen the
prison and the prisoners, and who were still alive when the
writer commenced his inquiries; private letters written during
the period of the Depot&rsquo;s existence; scanty paragraphs in
local and other newspapers; official reports and correspondence;
and, finally, the evidence of their pursuits, afforded by the
extant examples of the work executed by the prisoners during
their captivity.</p>
<p>The prisoners were almost all, either soldiers or sailors,
belonging to the enemy&rsquo;s army and navy, or the crews and
officers of privateers.&nbsp; Regulations as to parole varied
greatly during the course of the war, but the majority of the
officers and the civilians of good social standing, mostly
passengers on board ships which had been captured, were out on
parole.&nbsp; In each of three of the quadrangles there must have
been an average of about 1,750 prisoners, and in the fourth, the
north-eastern, in which two of the caserns were, from the <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>opening of
the Depot, divided off for the hospital, to which a third was
added later for the officers&rsquo; hospital, there were probably
about 500.&nbsp; This estimate is based upon returns which show
that on one occasion only was the number of prisoners returned as
low as 3,038.&nbsp; This was in 1799&mdash;when the total number
of prisoners in Britain was only 25,646. <a
name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a>&nbsp; The number had at that time been
reduced by a considerable exchange, and on other occasions the
numbers were much higher.&nbsp; Thus on the 10th April 1810, out
of 44,583 prisoners in Britain, 6,272 were at Norman Cross.&nbsp;
On the 11th June 1811, out of 49,132 in all Britain, 5,951 were
at Norman Cross.&nbsp; From these figures it is a fair deduction
that the prison population with which we have to deal averaged,
in the eighteen years during which the prison was occupied, about
6,000, distributed in four sections.&nbsp; Each of the three
larger groups occupied a separate quadrangle about 2&frac12;
acres in extent, their sleeping-places being four blocks of
buildings, in each of which slept 500 men, when they were
absolutely packed, 300 in the lower chambers, which were 12 feet
high, and 200 in the upper chambers, the height of which was 8
feet 6 inches; they occupied hammocks, arranged in the lower and
more lofty rooms, in three tiers, one above the other, and
suspended between posts 8 feet apart; in the upper room, the roof
of which was below the regulation height for three tiers, in two
tiers only.</p>
<p>The size of each block, determined by actual measurement of
the rubble foundation, or footing, still lying below the turf,
was 100 feet long by 22 feet wide.&nbsp; The hooks for the clews
of one end of the hammocks would be fixed into rails on the
wooden sides of the building, while for the clews at the foot of
the <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>hammocks, posts running along the whole length of the
building were erected at the regulation distance (8 feet from the
wall of the building), and into these hammock-posts the
stanchions were driven.&nbsp; Eight feet on the opposite side of
the building was occupied in the same way by the hammocks, and a
clear space of 100 feet by 6 would be left in the middle of the
chamber through which, on the upper floor, the single stair
landed.</p>
<p>In the Royal Navy at the present day the average width of the
hammock with a man in it is 18 inches, and they are packed only
one or two inches apart (the midshipmen and other junior officers
are allowed a foot between each hammock).</p>
<p>Assuming that the prisoners were allowed a little more space
than our bluejackets, say, 2 feet for each hammock, there would
be fifty hammocks along each side, and as the hammocks were hung
in tiers, three in the lower chamber and two in the upper
chamber, there would be 150 on each side of the building in the
lower chamber, and 100 in the upper chamber, that is, 500 in each
of the four caserns in the three quadrangles occupied by the
healthy prisoners.&nbsp; This calculation, which the author had
worked out before he had seen M. Foulley&rsquo;s description of
his model, corresponds with the figures he gives.</p>
<p>To the sailors the gymnastic performance necessary to get into
the upper hammock of a tier of three might be easy, but the
soldier would probably have many failures before he became
expert.&nbsp; When the head turnkey blew his horn at sunrise, the
first duty of the prisoners was to fold up the palliasse, rug,
and bolster allowed them, and then to take the clew off the hook
on the post, and to hang it with the other clew on the hook in
the wall, thus leaving the space which had been filled by the
stretched hammocks clear.&nbsp; The general body of the prisoners
would then turn out, the fatigue <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>party, one out of every twelve, that
is about thirty-six men for each casern, proceeding with their
domestic duties.&nbsp; These probably in and out of doors gave
them little spare time, when once in twelve days their turn for
duty came round for either amusement or other occupation.&nbsp;
There were all sorts and conditions of men among those who,
starting the day in this way, turned out into the
airing-court.</p>
<p>An old Mr. Lewin of Yaxley, born in 1801, two miles from
Norman Cross, was accustomed in his boyhood to visit, and get
occasional work at, the Depot.&nbsp; When interviewed by the
writer in 1894, he thus described the prisoners: &ldquo;Some of
them were very rich&rdquo; [<i>Lewin himself had been an
agricultural labourer all his life</i>], &ldquo;others very
poor.&nbsp; The poor ones used to hang out bags, and would cry,
as the people passed by, &lsquo;Drop a penny in my
bag.&rsquo;&nbsp; [<i>See the Frontispiece</i>.]&nbsp; They were
not dressed in uniform, but in ordinary clothes, some like
gentlemen, others like ragmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
place,&rdquo; said Lewin, &ldquo;was like a town.&nbsp; There
must have been near 50,000 people there.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
ninety-three when he was describing the prison, and to multiply
the figures by ten was probably due to the enchantment which
distance casts over experiences eighty years agone.</p>
<p>The morning meal was probably the next incident of the
day.&nbsp; The meals can have occupied but little time for those
poor fellows, who had nothing more than the daily ration to
depend upon; but probably, although the French Government did
nothing to supplement this ration, the French people, as well as
the relatives of the various prisoners, would remit money, of
which the poorer as well as the well-to-do would reap the
benefit.</p>
<p>It has already been mentioned that the British agent in Paris
had orders to supplement the ration supplied by the French
Government to the British prisoners, wherever he thought it
necessary, and, beyond this, subscriptions for our captives in
France were made in <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>various parts of the country.&nbsp; Mr. Maberley
Phillips, F.S.A., in a paper &ldquo;On the escape of the French
Prisoners of War from Jedburgh in 1813,&rdquo; gives the
particulars of an entry in the Vestry Book of St. Hilda&rsquo;s,
South Shields, which gives the details of a subscription in 1807,
by which the sum of &pound;226 7<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> was
collected for British prisoners in France, and remitted to the
committee at Lloyds, to be sent with the fund raised by them to
the agent in Paris.</p>
<p>The same spirit which influenced the British nation to send
succour to their countrymen would doubtless influence the French
people, although their Government, in accordance with their
system of conducting war, differed from the British Government as
to what was the duty of a nation at war towards its subjects in
detention in the enemy&rsquo;s country.&nbsp; The remittances
from abroad to the whole of the prisoners amounted, from 1797 to
1800, to several thousands of pounds, and remittances were still
continually arriving (Commissioner Serle&rsquo;s Report to the
Transport Board, 28th July 1800).&nbsp; This money passed through
the hands of the agent in the various prisons, and he was
directed not to hand it over except in small amounts, lest a
recipient might have sufficient to offer a too tempting bribe to
a sentry.</p>
<p>As to how the prisoners prepared their ration for their
several meals, how they utilised the vegetables and the various
table delicacies which they purchased in the market, we know
nothing.&nbsp; The absence of chimneys in the caserns shows that
no fires were allowed in them.&nbsp; It is possible that under
strict regulations they were allowed to make fires in the courts,
and abundance of peat from the neighbouring fen would be
obtainable at a very low price.&nbsp; The fact that a cauldron
for making the soup, which was removed from one of the
cook-houses and is now preserved at Elton Hall, measures 5 feet 1
in. across and 3 feet 6 in. deep, shows <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>that the
appointed and paid French cook made the bulk of the food.&nbsp;
Doubtless in nothing would there be more distinction between the
several prisoners than in the way they dealt with the ration.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The prisoners in each casern were divided into messes of
twelve, and one of their number attended at the cook-house and
brought the ration for the whole mess.</p>
<p>The monotonous recurrence of the roll-call and the visit of
the doctors were daily incidents.&nbsp; Next would possibly come
the daily ablutions, more or less extensive, probably performed,
with the washing of the clothes, at the wooden troughs,
represented in some of the plans, on either side of the wells,
the ground around being paved with flagstones to obviate mud and
dirt from the slopping.&nbsp; There was ample room in the
airing-court for such amusements and sports as these poor
cooped-up young fellows, many only boys (the separate prison for
boys was a late addition to the Depot, it is only shown in
MacGregor&rsquo;s plan and in Foulley&rsquo;s model) could
devise, and in these courts was carried on much of the work in
which so many of the prisoners were engaged, and which will be
discussed later on.</p>
<p>The domestic politics of the various prisons and the various
blocks must have run high; the prisoners were of course under a
despotism, but the choice of delegates for the market, for
inspection of the food, etc., was in their own hands.&nbsp; The
topic of conversation which must have most interested them must
have been the prospect of their liberation, and the course of the
war, as far as they could gather it, from the gossip of the
turnkeys and from what little they could hear in the
market.&nbsp; Each party of fresh arrivals would bring
news.&nbsp; They would have accounts of the escape of prisoners
from other prisons, and would have secret confidences and various
schemes for their own escape; they would hear of the incessant
plots for a general rising of all the prisoners in Britain, of
the progress and failure of <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>the negotiations for exchange, and
they would discuss these matters with the intensity of men, over
all of whom at all times hung the cloud of captivity, who all
felt in a greater or less degree the longing for freedom.</p>
<p>There was also the appointment by themselves of the delegates
who were to attend with the stewards of the prison and inspect
the bread, meat, and vegetables as they were delivered at the
western gate, in order to make sure that the goods were of proper
quality.&nbsp; One of the Prison Regulations speaks of &ldquo;the
turnkey or any other officer&rdquo; as the head of the prison
police.&nbsp; As from various returns we know that there was no
part of the British staff of the Depot, except the turnkeys, who
could be acting in the quadrangle as police, it is probable that
there was some scheme imposing on individual prisoners the duties
of assisting the turnkeys in enforcing the regulations.&nbsp; The
brigade-major could apparently march a patrol where he thought it
was needed.&nbsp; In case of any violence or resistance, the
turnkey called in the assistance of the sentries or a squad from
the barracks.</p>
<p>Even in the earlier years of the war there were doubtless many
of the prisoners who would adopt teaching as their work, and who
would, among the 1,500 who shared their quadrangle, find pupils
willing to pay for lessons, which would relieve the monotony of
their existence.&nbsp; There would be fencing masters, who would
fence with sticks, for any who had clandestinely obtained or
manufactured weapons dared not let them be seen; there were many
traders who made money legitimately, acting as middlemen between
the market at the gate and the prisoners in the enclosure; and
there were, the curse of the prison, those illicit traders and
usurers who bought the rations and clothes of their fellow
prisoners and reduced them to starvation, the unfortunate victims
being, as a rule, the slaves to the vice of gambling.&nbsp; The
moral degradation of the gambler <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>was, from the first, a source of
trouble to the authorities, and it was the wretched condition of
this vicious class which was the foundation for many of the
complaints made by the French agents.&nbsp; Both the usurious
traders and their victims were liable to punishment, as were also
the manufacturers of, and dealers in, contraband articles.&nbsp;
These last were assisted by persons outside, who are best
described as smugglers, their part in the proceedings being to
convey from this foreign community to the British subjects
outside, goods which, either from their intrinsic character or
from their liability to duty, could not be sold legitimately.</p>
<p>In the reports of the Commissioners of the Transport Board,
given in full in Nos. 29 and 30 of the correspondence published
in the Appendix to the Parliamentary Report already referred to,
it is stated that &ldquo;the prisoners in all the depots in the
country are at full liberty to exercise their industry within the
prisons, in manufacturing and selling any articles they may think
proper excepting those which would affect the Revenue in
opposition to the Laws, obscene toys and drawings, or articles
made either from their clothing or the prison stores, and by
means of this privilege some of them have been known to carry off
upon their release more than 100 guineas each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At some of the depots, special restrictions had to be made, on
account of objections raised in the neighbourhood on the ground
that the prisoners, supported out of the revenue provided by the
taxes which people had to pay, were allowed to undersell the
inhabitants in their own local industries.&nbsp; Thus at Penryn
the Frenchmen were stopped from making pastry and confectionery,
and the prohibition of the manufacture of straw plait at Norman
Cross was supposed to be based on the same grounds, combined with
the fact that it was thrown on the market duty-free.&nbsp; This
point will be dealt with later.</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>For the
sale of these goods, and for the purchase of goods from without,
there was in each prison square a sort of market, where business
was carried on, the sellers putting up stalls.&nbsp; Among other
things, they sold provisions and vegetables, doubtless making a
profit on what they had paid in the more important market which
was held under strict regulations, at the eastern gate of the
prison (at one period of the war twice a week only, at another
period daily).&nbsp; In this market delegates from the prisoners
met the dealers from without for traffic in the produce of the
neighbourhood and in such goods as the prisoners
required&mdash;clothes, feeding utensils, tools, and materials
for carrying on their work, etc.; here probably were handed out
to the village turner portions of bone carefully prepared for the
lathe by the prisoner who made the articles portions of which
were turned.&nbsp; Such examples are still extant.&nbsp; Here
also opportunities were found for disposing of the illicit
articles, which were a source of some profit to the prisoner, but
of far larger profit to the middleman outside.</p>
<p>The market was, as I have said, held under strict regulations;
every article made in the prison had attached to it its price,
and the name of the prisoner who made it.&nbsp; But, alas for the
fame of the deft individuals, who spent long years in the prison,
in the manufacture of these beautiful articles, the name was only
attached in temporary fashion, and the names of six only of the
artists of the 500 specimens in the Peterborough Museum are
preserved: that of Jean de la Porte, the producer of several
beautiful pictures in straw marquetry, Peterborough Cathedral
being a favourite subject with him and with other accomplished
artists in the prison; that of a M. Grieg, whose name appears on
a silk holder decorated with figures, birds, and square and
compass; Ribout, on a small box; Jacques Gourny, on a similar
specimen; Godfrov, on a highly decorated work cabinet; and Corn
on a silk holder.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>The
price of all the goods brought in from the neighbourhood was also
regulated by the agent, who saw that the prisoners were not
charged higher than the ordinary market price.&nbsp; It is
evident that there must have been some regulation as to who, from
among the prisoners, should be admitted from each
quadrangle.&nbsp; It is certain that the gates of the quadrangle
were not thrown open for the whole of the 5,000 or 6,000 to go to
the market, and it is probable that certain trusted individuals,
delegates from each prison, were marched under guard across the
turnkeys&rsquo; court, out on to the road between the squares, to
the east gate, through which they passed into the prison market
held in the space formed by the embrasure of the great outer
wall.&nbsp; Purchases for themselves and for those of their
comrades who had given them commissions were made by these
privileged men.&nbsp; On their return to their own prison square,
these men probably traded with their fellow prisoners in the
small market which was held in each quadrangle.&nbsp; There
appear to have been at one time stalls to which the public were
admitted on Sundays to purchase the articles made by the
prisoners&mdash;that is, if the following paragraph is well
founded:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Barracks were erected on a very liberal and
excellent plan for the security of French prisoners who were
confined here during the late war, and employed themselves in
making bone toys, and straw boxes, and many other small articles,
to which people of all descriptions were admitted on Sundays,
when more than &pound;200 a day has been frequently laid out in
purchasing their labours of the preceding week.&nbsp; It is
capable of containing 7 or 8,000 men, and has barracks for two
regiments of infantry.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Crosby&rsquo;s Complete
Pocket Gazette</i>, 2nd Edition, 1818, Yaxley.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paragraph is somewhat puzzling, but it is certain <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>that it
states that people of all descriptions were admitted somewhere on
Sundays, and it can hardly have been into the bone toys, straw
boxes, and other small articles.&nbsp; The extract was sent to me
by the Rev. Father A. H. Davis (a connection through his mother
of one of the French prisoners).&nbsp; He remarks that this
Sunday trading was &ldquo;very unusual for the date of the Norman
Cross prison&rdquo;; he suggests that the traffic may have been
regarded, on the part of the purchasers, as a pure act of
charity, and the sellers were of course accustomed to the
Continental Sunday. <a name="citation99"></a><a
href="#footnote99" class="citation">[99]</a></p>
<p>The markets and the trading must have afforded one of the
chief interests in the prison life, and they have therefore been
described as fully as is possible from scanty records.&nbsp; The
daily inspection by the doctors has been alluded to; sickness and
death came within the precincts of the Depot as to every other
community of men.&nbsp; These will be dealt with in a later
chapter.&nbsp; There was no prison chapel.&nbsp; It is possible
there were attempts at something like prison worship; it is
certain that at one time priests were allowed to reside in the
prison, and in the last years of its existence there was a
ministering Roman Catholic priest, the Bishop of Moulins, who was
banished from France in 1791, and whose brief history, written by
himself, will be found in Appendix G.&nbsp; An examination of the
records shows that a large number of the prisoners were from
Protestant districts of France, but the majority were, of course,
if they professed any religion, Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>This review of the chief factors in the prisoners&rsquo; <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>life will
enable the reader to form in his own mind a picture of what that
life was, the main feature behind the stockade fences, which were
enclosed by the outer prison wall, being that the community lived
year after year with no female element&mdash;no solace from
mother, wife, sweetheart, child, or female friend or adviser of
any kind&mdash;and yet we have the evidence of Mr. Comm. Serle
that they &ldquo;show their satisfaction in the habits of
cheerfulness peculiar to themselves&rdquo;; <a
name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a"
class="citation">[100a]</a> and the American prisoner who, under
the <i>nom de plume</i> &ldquo;Greenhorn,&rdquo; published his
experiences of Dartmoor in 1813, is reported by Mr. Basil Thomson
<a name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b"
class="citation">[100b]</a> to have been most struck on entering
the prison by &ldquo;the high spirits of the
multitude.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had expected &ldquo;to find hunger,
misery and crime, but everything indicated contentment, order and
good fellowship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us hope that, notwithstanding the fact that at Norman
Cross many of the prisoners had been confined for ten years,
while of those whom &ldquo;Greenhorn&rdquo; gazed upon, none had
been behind the granite walls of Dartmoor more than four years,
the dominant spirit was one of &ldquo;contentment, order and
good-fellowship&rdquo;; but, unfortunately, it is beyond doubt
that there was in the prison a submerged stratum of hungry,
miserable, criminal individuals, who had been unable to resist
the evil influence of their surroundings on natural or acquired
tendencies.</p>
<p>The preceding pages should enable the reader, throwing his
imagination back a hundred years to Norman Cross, to conjure up,
in place of the photographic picture of forty acres of still and
silent pasture, without one human inhabitant, which the camera
would produce to-day, a cinematograph series exhibiting a moving
panorama, set in the great group of wooden buildings, barracks
and prisons, in which lodged nearly 10,000 men, with all the busy
life of such a crowd.&nbsp; On the <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>roads enclosing two sides of the
site (one of which&mdash;the great North Road&mdash;was then
always alive with the ever-flowing streams of traffic going and
returning between London and the North) are soldiers passing to
and fro, and civilians of all kinds having business at the
Depot.&nbsp; Entering the gate on the Peterborough Road, are seen
the prison market on the left and the Eastern Barracks on the
right, and in the space between are soldiers off duty, local
merchants carrying their goods to the market, the prisoners,
officers, and civilians allowed on parole, visitors with orders,
friends of the British officers, etc.; while at the western gate
on the North Road not only is the busy life of the main entrance
to the western barracks thrown on the screen, but also the carts
and porters bringing in the daily supplies for feeding the
thousands within the walls, passing through the gates, and
filling with envy the half-starved British workmen who, from the
road, gaze on the piled-up loads of meat, bread, and vegetables;
beyond the gates the busy barrack life&mdash;companies of
soldiers changing guard, sentries on their beat pass by; and then
appears the outer wall of the prison, stockade fence or brick
wall, according to the year in which the imaginary camera is at
work; at the eastern of the four gates appears the busy market,
with the vendors of the goods, vegetables, eggs, and farm
produce, clothes, hardware, and other necessaries for sale at
their stalls, and the prisoners from within making their
purchases, and offering for sale products of their skill in
handicraft; a cannon with its muzzle directed inwards to the
prison commands the gate in the market fence, that of the prison
itself, and the roadway to the Central Block House.&nbsp; Between
the wall and the stockade enclosing the separate quadrangles, and
on the cross roads which separate the four blocks, sixty
sentries, posted day and night, are pacing their beats; while
fenced in by the inner stockade are seen in each quadrangle
crowds of prisoners, the <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>majority young, a few old
veterans&mdash;well fed and half-starved, well clothed and
ragged, some in the yellow suit supplied by the British
Government, industrious and idle&mdash;all forced to live
together under the same conditions of isolation from the outer
world.</p>

<p>Here appear, in a somewhat crowded quadrangle, the thickly
packed 1,600 or 1,700 men, groups of whom appear on the screen,
some availing themselves of a clear space are dancing, others
racing, or fencing with single sticks; then is seen a group
carrying on, with violent gesticulation, a hot argument, so
heated has it become between two of the disputants that it may
end in blows, and possibly in a duel, for duels with extemporised
weapons were not infrequent and were occasionally fatal; another
group are discussing earnestly, but quietly and in subdued tones,
the possibility of the general rising of all the prisoners in
England, news having been smuggled in to them that a plan for
such a rising is under consideration by the French
Government.&nbsp; Then follow pictures of men at work; they are
mostly seated on boxes or rough prison-made stools on the flagged
pavement which surrounds the airing-court&mdash;they are very
numerous.&nbsp; Here a man in the corner, which he has
appropriated for months, is cutting, scraping, polishing, and
fitting together the pieces of bone which he is building into the
beautiful model of the guillotine which now, a hundred years
later, has found its way to the Peterborough Museum; he has
bought in the market a good assortment of tools, which lie beside
him.&nbsp; Then comes a group of men, who have selected a spot
sheltered from the wind, and who are skilled in straw marquetry,
employed in coating well-made work boxes, desks, etc., also all
prison work, with marquetry pictures of varied and beautiful
designs, so beautiful and so delicate, that we who, a hundred
years after the workers and their prison vanished from Norman
Cross, see the objects, can only marvel at the <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>skill and
the patient perseverance which could accomplish such work in such
conditions.</p>
<p>A Dutch sailor appears giving the finishing touch to a
marvellous model of a ship made from the bones received from the
cooking-house, he is just fastening the Dutch flag to the ship;
grouped around him are many of his admiring countrymen.&nbsp;
Then appears on the screen a group who reveal a different side of
the life in the quadrangles: a crowd surrounds a party of
gamblers, and crushing through them are several anxious, ragged,
emaciated men who, having just sold in advance their rations for
several days, in order to obtain money for the indulgence of
their passion, are eager to join in the game.&nbsp; Here and
there pass by wretched half-naked members of the submerged tenth,
which has developed within a year of the opening of the prison,
seeking for scraps of food to appease the hunger pangs which have
arisen from their selling their rations to the wretch, the
usurer, who now appears searching among the losers, in the
dispersing crowd for a fresh victim; this man is looked upon by
the authorities as a bigger sinner than the starving gamblers
themselves. <a name="citation103"></a><a href="#footnote103"
class="citation">[103]</a></p>
<p>Another group of young fellows is seen taking lessons in
English from a polyglot; and so picture succeeds picture, until
we see in another quadrangle more men at work, but the crowd
generally engaged in and greatly excited over an election.&nbsp;
The commissary whose duty it is to inspect, in the interest of
his fellow prisoners, the supplies of food as they are delivered
at the prison, has proved unsatisfactory, and permission has been
given for the choice of another prisoner to replace him.&nbsp;
There are several parties in the prison each anxious that one of
their own group should be selected, hence the contest and the
excited crowd of speakers and listeners.&nbsp; Some of the
prisoners are &ldquo;mugwumps&rdquo; and take no interest in
politics, even such as would touch their personal<a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>interests,
and of these a crowd interested in theology fills the screen;
they are listening to a hot argument between a Protestant and a
Romanist&mdash;an argument frequently interrupted by a little
party of those who worship only the goddess of reason.&nbsp; Then
follow on the screen the squad told off for fatigue duties for
the day; they have just finished their tasks, and are settling
down to their usual occupations, some throwing themselves down to
rest, others joining a party whose sides are shaking with
laughter, as they listen to two or three young men, excellent
actors, who are improvising a scene, caricaturing the English,
and introducing the peculiarities of the agent, turnkey, and
other officials of the prison. <a name="citation104"></a><a
href="#footnote104" class="citation">[104]</a></p>
<p>The pictures of the next quadrangle are much the same.&nbsp; A
man is seen in violent grief with the letter in his hand which
has just announced to him the death of wife, father, mother, or
child, leaving him more desolate than ever.&nbsp; At the
turnkey&rsquo;s gate a group of men are being led off with a
guard of soldiers to the Black Hole for a brutal assault on one
of their fellow prisoners.&nbsp; But what has happened to alter
the characters of the pictures when the fourth quadrangle appears
on the screen?&nbsp; Work has stopped, arguments have ceased, the
excellent meal, with numerous luxuries which a party of prisoners
well supplied with money have prepared as the great event of
their day, lies on the table before them disregarded, the food
untasted.&nbsp; Where men are speaking at all, it is with the
intensity of bitter disappointment, here and there with violent
expressions of anger against the authors of their misery.</p>
<p>For some months it has been known to these men <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>that
negotiations were going on between the two Governments for a
General Exchange of prisoners, and although there have been to
the knowledge of the prisoners many hitches, yet for the last few
weeks it has been rumoured that these difficulties were all
overcome, and the announcement of the day when the exchange
should commence has been hourly expected; but, alas! in place of
the expected news, one of the turnkeys has just handed in an
authoritative statement that the negotiations have fallen
through, and that all hope of freedom must again be banished from
their thoughts!</p>
<p>To know the agony of despair that must on such a day have
seized those 6,000 men, one must have shared their captivity and
gone through their experiences.</p>
<p>The news from the outside world, the progress of the war, the
successes and defeats on either side, the prospects of peace,
must have varied the mood of the prisoners from day to day; we
can only hope that the national contentment and cheerfulness was
for the majority the usual tone.</p>
<p>This panorama of life in the prison represents only what that
life was in good weather.&nbsp; When the weather was too
inclement for the outdoor life commanded by the regulations, and
when the prisoners were crowded in the bare and dismal caserns,
contentment and high spirits can scarcely have been the dominant
tone of the inmates.&nbsp; In the surveyor&rsquo;s report, <a
name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105"
class="citation">[105]</a> referred to in a former chapter,
mention is made of the holes cut by the prisoners in the walls of
the caserns; on such a day these would be valued not so much for
light and ventilation as for the opportunity which they afforded
of a glimpse of the world outside&mdash;a view of the traffic on
the road and of rustic life which would remind many of similar
scenes from which the conscription had torn them to fight the
battles of Buonaparte.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>What
a tale is told by those holes cut by the prisoners in the outer
walls!</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tis pleasant through the loopholes of
retreat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To peep at such
a world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor fellows, the peep they got through the holes they cut was
their only share for years of the world outside.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that the habits and customs of the
various depots would be almost identical; the Government
regulations under which they lived and which ruled the life of
the prisoners were the same for all.&nbsp; There might be points
of etiquette and social intercourse, derived from local
circumstances, traditional in each prison; but there were
constant interchanges of prisoners, and these men would take with
them to the new prison the habits, including unfortunately the
worst vices, which they had acquired in the old one.&nbsp; At
Norman Cross there were, before it was completed, men waiting to
be received into the prison who had been captives at the Depot of
Falmouth, where they had been distributed in the town itself in
Roskoff, Kerquillack, and Penryn, whence they were removed,
because, in consequence of this multiplication of the places of
confinement, the administration was not only inefficient, but
extravagant.&nbsp; Many others were brought from Porchester and
other prisons on account of their overcrowded condition.&nbsp;
Mr. Perrot, the first agent (Mr. Delafons, it will be remembered,
though the first agent appointed, served only a few days,
ordering the first stores from the immediate locality and from
Lynn and Wisbech, but acting only until Mr. Perrot arrived) came
from Porchester, and thus both the administrators and the
prisoners would bring old prison customs with them.&nbsp; It was
not until the influx of Dutch prisoners, after Duncan&rsquo;s
victory off Camperdown on the 11th October following the April in
which the prison <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>was opened, that any number of prisoners passed,
without intermediate imprisonment, direct from the Transports to
Norman Cross.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause may have been, whether it was owing to the
phlegmatic disposition of the Dutch or the mercurial temperament
of the French, all accounts show that the general conduct of the
former was much more commendable than that of the latter.&nbsp;
Beyond a few escapes, which were only natural, no offences are
attributed to the Dutch.&nbsp; For the misdemeanours and
felonies, great and small, the French were responsible.&nbsp; The
gamblers who arrived from other prisons would doubtless find
among the fresh arrivals men, without other resources, ready to
relieve the dreary monotony of prison life by the excitement of
dice box or cards.&nbsp; However it may have originated, it is
certain that, within three years from the day when the first
prisoner entered Norman Cross, the vice of gambling was a curse
in the prison, and its slaves had become the victims of cruel,
avaricious usurers, whose guilty practices thwarted the efforts
of the authorities to insure the health and comfort of those in
their charge.&nbsp; Early in 1800, Captain Woodriff, the agent,
sent a report to the Transport Office which induced the
commissioners to send to M. Otto, the French commissary in
London, a letter, <a name="citation107"></a><a
href="#footnote107" class="citation">[107]</a> from which the
following is an extract:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are in those prisons some men, if
they deserve that name, who possess money, with which they
purchase at the daily market whatever is allowed to enter, and
with those articles they purchase of some unfortunate and
unthinking Fellow-prisoner, his Rations of Bread for several days
together, and frequently <i>both Bread and Beef for a month</i>,
which he, the merchant, seizes upon daily, and sells it out again
to some other unfortunate being, on the same usurious terms;
allowing <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>the former one halfpennyworth of potatoes daily to keep
him alive; not contented with this more than savage barbarity he
purchases next his clothes, and bedding, and sees the miserable
man lie naked on the planks, unless he will consent to allow him
one halfpenny a night to lie in his own hammock, and which he
makes him pay by a further Deprivation of his rations when his
original debt is paid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 9th September of the same year, 1800, the approach of
winter making the matter very urgent, Captain Woodriff again
reported to the commissioners that nothing he could do prevented
the prisoners from selling their rations of provisions for days
to come, and their bedding, that several of the French prisoners
were destitute of clothing and bedding, that one or two had died,
and that in his opinion, unless some clothing was issued to the
prisoners, <i>many</i> of them would die should the winter be
severe.&nbsp; These poor victims of their vicious passions are
called in many documents &ldquo;Les Mis&eacute;rables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no reason to doubt that the habits described in these
reports were the true explanation of the want of food and
clothing, for which the French Government blamed the British; but
there is also too much reason to believe that many of these
prisoners, the victims of their fellow captives the usurers, and
of their own passion for gambling, died of want in <i>our</i>
prisons, a fact for which we as a nation can only plead the
blinding animosity which filled the hearts and brains of the
combatants in the wars from 1793 to 1815.</p>
<p>It is possible that besides these, there were others who,
although well supplied with food, were at times clothed in rags
owing to the obstinacy with which each Government clung to its
own view, as to whose duty it was to clothe the prisoners.</p>
<p>On the 14th March 1800, the First Consul issued an <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Edict, in
which among other articles was one <i>directing</i> that the
British Government should clothe their French prisoners.</p>
<p>To this Edict the French Minister for Foreign Affairs referred
Captain Cotes (the English commissary in Paris), in order that he
might see, among other things, that Buonaparte had determined
&ldquo;that the said prisoners should be clothed by the British
Government.&rdquo; <a name="citation109"></a><a
href="#footnote109" class="citation">[109]</a>&nbsp; This Edict,
cancelling an agreement previously entered into between the two
Governments, was not communicated direct to the British
Government; and from a letter written by the Secretary of State
for War to the Lords of the Admiralty on the 4th December 1800,
it is clear that the issuing of this Edict, practically an order
from the head of the Government of the country with which we were
at war, directing the British Government to adopt a certain
course, had only increased the determination of the Government to
hold its own.&nbsp; The Secretary for War, Mr. Dundas, in this
letter justifies the action of the British Government, and to
strengthen his appeal to the French Authorities to do what he
considered their duty, and clothe the prisoners, he quotes the
fact &ldquo;that misery, sickness, and a heavy mortality prevail
among the French prisoners in the various depots in this country,
while the Dutch, under the same management, and with the same
allowances in every respect as the French, but clothed by their
own Government, continue to enjoy their usual health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who read this correspondence, now in this twentieth
century, when the bitter animosity between the two countries has
died away, must feel that the obstinacy was not confined to the
French, and must wish that the British had done sooner, what they
ultimately did, clothe the prisoners and debit the French
Government with the cost.</p>
<p>In the correspondence I have quoted, the usurer, <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>rather than
his victims, is spoken of as the cause of the misery, and no
mention is made of gambling.&nbsp; But in other reports this vice
is mentioned as the root of the evil, the result of which was
that when an epidemic broke out, the mortality among these naked,
starving wretches was terrible.&nbsp; Among the material relating
to Norman Cross, picked out from the miscellaneous thousands of
papers at the Record Office, was a bundle of long slips of
paper&mdash;Certificates&mdash;ruled out with columns, eleven in
all, corresponding to those in the prison register, and ending
with one for the date of death, and another for the fatal
disorder or casualty.&nbsp; Among the large bundle for the year
1800, a year of terrible mortality owing to the presence of an
epidemic, is a certificate, dated 14th June, which bears an
irregular note in pencil, made apparently by the surgeon when he
forwarded the slip to the agent; the pencilled note on this
certificate is a terrible revelation of what, in that year, was
going on in the prison at Norman Cross.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You see, my dear Sir, since our selection
of the invalids, and the benefit of warm weather, we have had but
one death this ten days.&nbsp; If another batch of those
vagabonds, who by their bad conduct defy all the benefits the
Benevolence of this country bestows upon them, were to be sent
away in September next, we might expect great benefit from it in
the winter, for to a certainty all these blackguards will die in
the winter.&nbsp; Compare sixty a week with one in ten
days.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this scrap we learn how terrible was the mortality, and
how bad was the character of these wretched men; we learn also
that when all the steps taken to reform them had failed, some
system of segregation and removal to the hulks or elsewhere was
finally recommended.&nbsp; There is evidence in a letter of M.
Otto&rsquo;s that a large number of invalids and men of the class
spoken of as &ldquo;Les Mis&eacute;rables,&rdquo; or less
sympathetically <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>by the surgeon as &ldquo;these blackguards,&rdquo; was
sent back to France.&nbsp; Two years after this pencilled note
was written, all the prisons, both in Britain and France, were
emptied, and the prisoners restored to their native countries;
but when they refilled after the renewal of the war in 1803 under
the same conditions, the same depravity and suffering
developed.</p>
<p>At Dartmoor, 1809 to 1816, there are records, especially those
of the Americans, which furnish full particulars of the internal
life of that prison, particulars which in the case of Norman
Cross can only be gathered from scraps such as the pencilled note
just referred to.&nbsp; Mr. Basil Thomson has permitted the
reprint in this history of his chapter on these reprobates in
Dartmoor.&nbsp; It is terrible reading, but I avail myself of Mr.
Thomson&rsquo;s permission, because there is little doubt that
much of the description of these self-styled &ldquo;Romans&rdquo;
at Dartmoor would apply equally to &ldquo;Les
Mis&eacute;rables&rdquo; at Norman Cross, and that the Norman
Cross &ldquo;Blackguards&rdquo; were, like the
&ldquo;Romans,&rdquo; ostracised by their fellow prisoners, and
were in a similar, if in a less systematic fashion than their
Dartmoor brethren, segregated by natural selection from their
comrades, and herded together in special parts of the
prisons.</p>
<p>From a careful perusal of the death certificates for the year
1801, when the terrible epidemic, commencing in November 1800,
carried off a thousand victims, it would appear that Block 13,
that behind the hospital caserns in the north-east quadrangle,
was the habitat of &ldquo;Les Mis&eacute;rables.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There are constantly recurring notes at the end of the
certificate to the effect: &ldquo;This prisoner had sold his
clothes and rations; he was from No. 13.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cause
of death given was debility.&nbsp; There are other entries, with
the simple note, &ldquo;Debility, from 13.&rdquo; <a

<p class="gutsumm">&ldquo;LES MIS&Eacute;RABLES&rdquo; AND THE
&ldquo;ROMANS&rdquo; OF DARTMOOR</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
are these<br />
So wither&rsquo;d and so wild in their attire,<br />
That look not like th&rsquo; inhabitants o&rsquo; th&rsquo;
earth,<br />
And yet are on&rsquo;t?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>, <i>Macbeth</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prototypes of the self-styled
&ldquo;Romans&rdquo; of Dartmoor were the prisoners of Norman
Cross, known and mentioned, ten years before Dartmoor was built,
in various official documents as &ldquo;Les
Mis&eacute;rables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has already been stated that the absence of any description
of the internal life of the Norman Cross Prison, written by an
inmate, renders it impossible to give details which in the case
of Dartmoor can be gathered from accounts published by French and
American prisoners who were there incarcerated.</p>
<p>The author has, therefore, gladly availed himself of the
permission given by Mr. Basil Thomson, to reproduce here the
chapter of his book in which he describes &ldquo;Les
Mis&eacute;rables&rdquo; of Dartmoor.&nbsp; The incidents in
their life presented by Thomson are not, of course,
<i>identical</i> with those of the same class at Norman
Cross.&nbsp; The Norman Cross prisoners were not banished to a
cockloft, and, although they may have been confined to one floor
in one block, probably No. 13, they still retained the hammocks,
in which many (during the awful epidemic of 1801) died before
they could be removed to the hospital, succumbing at once to the
malady owing to the debility resulting from their <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>nakedness
and starvation.&nbsp; The description of the sleeping
arrangements of the &ldquo;Romans&rdquo; does not therefore apply
to &ldquo;Les Mis&eacute;rables&rdquo; of Norman Cross.</p>
<p>Similar vices and similar conditions of life produce similar
results, but the impression left after reading Thomson&rsquo;s
graphic and terrible picture of the &ldquo;Romans&rdquo; of
Dartmoor is only more intense, in consequence of its details,
than that left after reading the laconic statements contained in
the letters and reports of Captain Woodriff, Commissioner Serle,
and others as to the same class at Norman Cross.</p>
<p>The authorities at both prisons were equally powerless to put
down the gambling and the usury with all its attendant
miseries.&nbsp; It is somewhat singular that the
&ldquo;Romans&rdquo; appear to have withstood disease, while in
the epidemic at Norman Cross, which was probably enteric fever, a
disease at that date not differentiated from other conditions,
such as debility, diarrhoea, simple fever, etc., &ldquo;Les
Mis&eacute;rables,&rdquo; as evidenced by the surgeon&rsquo;s
notes, succumbed. <a name="citation113"></a><a
href="#footnote113" class="citation">[113]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There were well-defined grades of society among the
prisoners.&nbsp; The first, called &ldquo;Les Lords,&rdquo;
consisted of men of good family who were drawing on their bankers
or receiving regular remittances from home; &ldquo;Les
Labourers&rdquo; were those who added to their rations by the
manufacture of articles for sale in the market; &ldquo;Les
Indiff&eacute;rents&rdquo; did nothing but lounge about the
yards, and had to content themselves with the Government rations;
&ldquo;Les Missables&rdquo; were the gamblers and hatchers of
mischief.&nbsp; The fifth grade is so remarkable that it deserves
a chapter to itself.&nbsp; It was also composed of habitual
gamblers, nick-named ironically &ldquo;Les Kaiserlies&rdquo; by
the other prisoners, but generally known by the title chosen by
themselves, &ldquo;Les Romains,&rdquo; <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>because the
cockloft, to which they were banished in each prison, was called
&ldquo;Le Capitole.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cock-lofts had been intended
by the architect for promenade in wet weather, but they had soon
to be put to this baser use.</p>
<p>To the sociologist there can be nothing more significant than
the fact that a body of civilised men, some of them well
educated, will under certain circumstances adopt a savage and
bestial mode of life, not as a relapse, but as an organised
proceeding for the gratification of their appetites and as a
revolt against the trammels of social law.&nbsp; The evolution of
the &ldquo;Romans&rdquo; was natural enough.&nbsp; The gambling
fever seized upon the entire prison, and the losers, having
nothing but their clothes and bedding to stake, turned these into
money and lost them.&nbsp; Unable to obtain other garments, and
feeling themselves shunned by their former companions, they
betook themselves to the society of men as unfortunate as
themselves, and went to live in the cockloft, because no one who
lived in the more desirable floors cared to have them as
neighbours.&nbsp; As they grew in numbers they began to feel a
pride in their isolation, and to persuade themselves that they
had come to it by their own choice.&nbsp; In imitation of the
floors below, where a &ldquo;Commissaire&rdquo; was chosen by
public election, and implicitly obeyed, they elected some genial,
devil-may-care rascal to be their &ldquo;General,&rdquo; who only
held office because he never attempted to enforce his authority
in the interests of decency and order.&nbsp; At the end of the
first six months the number of admitted &ldquo;Romans&rdquo; was
250, and in the later years it exceeded 500, though the number
was always fluctuating.&nbsp; In order to qualify for the Order,
it was necessary to consent to the sale of every remaining
garment and article of bedding to purchase tobacco for the use of
the community.&nbsp; The communism was complete.&nbsp; Among the
whole 500 there was no kind of private property, except a few
filthy rags, donned as a concession <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>to social prejudice.&nbsp; A few old
blankets held in common, with a hole in the middle for the head
like a poncho, were used by those whose business took them into
the yards.</p>
<p>In the Capitole itself every one lived in a state of nudity,
and slept naked on the concrete floor, for the only hammock
allowed was that of the &ldquo;General,&rdquo; who slept in the
middle and allocated the lairs of his constituents.&nbsp; To this
end a rough sort of discipline was maintained, for whereas 500
men could sleep without much discomfort on a single floor in
three tiers of hammocks, the actual floor space was insufficient
for more than a third of that number of human bodies lying side
by side.&nbsp; At night, therefore, the Capitole must have been
an extraordinary spectacle.&nbsp; The floor was carpeted with
nude bodies, all lying on the same side, so closely packed that
it was impossible to get a foot between them.&nbsp; At nightfall
the &ldquo;General&rdquo; shouted &ldquo;Fall in,&rdquo; and the
men ranged themselves in two lines facing one another.&nbsp; At a
second word of command, alternate files took two paces to the
front and rear and closed inward, and at the word
&ldquo;Bas&rdquo; they all lay down on their right sides.&nbsp;
At intervals during the night the &ldquo;General&rdquo; would cry
&ldquo;Pare &agrave; viser&rdquo; (Attention!), &ldquo;A Dieu,
Va!&rdquo; and they would all turn over.</p>
<p>From morning till night groups of Romans were to be seen
raking the garbage heaps for scraps of offal, potato peelings,
rotten turnips, and fish-heads, for though they drew their ration
of soup at mid-day, they were always famishing, partly because
the ration itself was insufficient, partly because they exchanged
their rations with the infamous provision-buyers for tobacco,
with which they gambled.&nbsp; Pride was certainly not a failing
of which they could be accused.&nbsp; In the alleys between the
tiers of hammocks on the floors below you might always see some
of them lurking.&nbsp; If a man were peeling a potato, a dozen of
these wretches would be <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>round him in a moment to beg for the
peel; they would form a ring round every mess bucket, like hungry
dogs, watching the eaters in the hope that one would throw away a
morsel of gristle, and fighting over every bone.&nbsp; Sometimes
the continual state of starvation and cold did its work, and the
poor wretch was carried to the hospital to die; but generally the
bodies of the Romans acquired a toughened fibre, which seemed
immune from epidemic disease.</p>
<p>Very soon after the occupation of the prison the Romans had
received their nickname, and had been expelled from the society
of decent men, for we find that, on August 15th, 1809, five
hundred Romans received permission to pay a sort of state visit
to No. 6 prison.&nbsp; At the head of the procession marched
their &ldquo;General,&rdquo; clad in a flash uniform made of
blankets, embroidered with straw, which looked like gold lace at
a distance.&nbsp; Behind him capered the band&mdash;twenty
grotesque vagabonds blowing flageolets and trumpets, and beating
iron kettles and platters.&nbsp; The ragged battalion marched in
column of fours along the grass between the grille and the
boundary wall without a rag on any of them but a breech clout,
and they would have kept their absurd gravity till the end, had
not a rat chanced to run out of the cookhouse.&nbsp; This was too
much for them; breaking rank, they chased it back into the
kitchen, and the most nimble caught it and, after scuffling for
it with a neighbour, tore it to pieces with his teeth and ate it
raw.&nbsp; The rest, with whetted appetites, fell upon the loaves
and looted them.</p>
<p>The guard was called out, and the soldiers marched into the
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e with fixed bayonets; but were immediately
surrounded by the naked mob, disarmed with shouts of laughter,
and marched off as prisoners towards the main gate amid cries of
&ldquo;<i>Vive l&rsquo;Empereur</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here they were
met by Captain Cotgrave hurrying to the rescue at the head of a
strong detachment.&nbsp; The <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>&ldquo;General&rdquo; of the Romans
halted his men and made a mock heroic speech to the agent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, striking a theatrical attitude,
&ldquo;we were directing our steps to your house to hand over to
your care our prisoners and their arms.&nbsp; This is only a
little incidental joke as far as your heroic soldiers are
concerned, who are now as docile as sheep.&nbsp; We now beg you
to order double rations to be issued as a reward for our
gallantry, and also to make good the breach which we have just
made in the provisions of our honourable hosts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Captain Cotgrave struggled with his gravity during this harangue,
but the &ldquo;General&rdquo; had nevertheless to spend eight
days in the <i>cachot</i> for his escapade, while his naked
followers were driven back to their quarters with blows from the
flat of the muskets.&nbsp; For a long time after this the life of
the soldiers was made miserable with banter, and they would bring
their bayonets down to the charge whenever a prisoner feigned to
approach them.</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, there were among the Romans a number
of young men of good family who were receiving a regular
remittance from their friends in France.&nbsp; When the quarterly
remittance arrived, the young man would borrow a suit of clothes
in which to fetch the money from the Agent&rsquo;s office, and,
having handed over &pound;1 to the &ldquo;General&rdquo; to be
spent in tobacco or potatoes for the community, would take his
leave, buy clothes, and settle down in one of the other floors as
a civilised being.&nbsp; But a fortnight later the twenty-five
louis would have melted away at the gaming-tables, clothes and
bedding followed, and the prodigal would slink back to his old
associates, who received him with a boisterous welcome.&nbsp;
During the brief intervals when he was clothed and in his right
mind, many efforts were made by the decent prisoners to restrain
him from ruin; but either the gambling fever or a natural
distaste for restraint always proved too strong, and no instance
of permanent reclamation in the prison is <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>recorded.&nbsp; It was otherwise when the Romans were
restored to liberty.&nbsp; One would think that such
creatures&mdash;half-ape and half-hog&mdash;had finally cut
themselves off from civilised society, and that they ended their
lives in the slums and stews of Paris.&nbsp; That this was not
the case is the strangest part of this social phenomenon.&nbsp;
In the year 1829 an officer who had been in Dartmoor on
forfeiture of parole attended mass in a village in Picardy,
through which he happened to be passing.&nbsp; The cur&eacute;
preached an eloquent and spiritual sermon, a little above the
heads of his rural congregation.&nbsp; One of his auditors was
strangely moved, not by the matter of the sermon, but by vague
reminiscences, gradually growing clearer, evoked by the features
and gestures of the preacher.&nbsp; So certain did he feel that
he had last seen this suave and reverend priest raking an offal
heap in the garb of Adam that he knocked at the sacristy door
after the service.&nbsp; The cur&eacute; received him formally
with the &ldquo;to-what-do-I-owe-the-honour&rdquo; manner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Were you not once a prisoner at the Depot of
Dartmoor?&rdquo;&nbsp; The priest flushed to his tonsure and
stammered, but at last faltered an affirmative, adding sadly that
imprisonment was very harmful both to body and soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember me?&rdquo; the officer asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&nbsp; It was you who so often preached
good morals to me.&nbsp; It is a long time ago, and, as you see,
God has worked a miracle in my soul.&nbsp; Evil example and a
kind of fatal attraction towards vice dragged me down; I was
young then.&nbsp; But do not let us talk of that horrible time,
which I look upon as an incurable wound in my life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
An invitation to dinner followed the interview, and the visitor
noticed that his host was no anchorite in the matter of food and
drink.&nbsp; As he warmed with wine he became more confidential,
and even a little scandalous, though he took occasion more than
once to remind his guest that if in his youth his life had <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>been
shameful, at least he had the consolation of remembering that it
was never criminal.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in the later stages of
the repast, there seemed to be a faint afterglow of the volcanic
eruption of his youth when he lived in the
&ldquo;Capitole.&rdquo;&nbsp; This man had been one of those who
had received regular remittances from his friends in France, and
who, after a brief orgy at the gaming-tables, had rooted his way
back to the swine-pen in the cockloft.&nbsp; His parishioners
affirmed him to be a man of great piety and open-handed
charity.&nbsp; They knew nothing of his past, and his guest was
careful to respect his secret.</p>
<p>In August 1846 one of the highest administrative posts under
Louis Philippe was filled by a man of great ability, one of those
officials who are selected by the Press for flattering
eulogium.&nbsp; Yet he, too, had been a Roman, and there must
have been many in France who knew that the breast then plastered
with decorations had once been bare to the icy winds of
Dartmoor.</p>
<p>In 1844 there was in Paris a merchant who had amassed a large
fortune in trade.&nbsp; His little circle of vulgar plutocrats
was wearied with the stories of his war service and the leading
part he had taken in the internal affairs of the war prison at
Dartmoor.&nbsp; He seemed quite to have forgotten that the
&ldquo;leading part&rdquo; was an unerring nose for fish offal in
the garbage heap, wherein he excelled all the other naked inmates
of the &ldquo;Capitole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they grew in numbers, from being objects of commiseration
the Romans became to be a terror to the community.&nbsp; Theft,
pillage, stabbings, and the darkest form of vice were practised
among them almost openly.&nbsp; Unwashed and swarming with
vermin, they stalked from prison to prison begging, scavenging,
quarrelling, pilfering from the provision carts, throwing stones
at any that interfered with them.</p>
<p>It was this formidable body whose condition so <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>shocked the
Americans on their first arrival.&nbsp; They were the analogues
of the &ldquo;Rough Alleys&rdquo; in the American prison, but
they were more bestial and less aggressive.</p>
<p>As it is not mentioned in the official records, let us hope
that one horrible story, told by a French prisoner, is
untrue.&nbsp; He says that when the bakehouse was burned down on
October 8th, 1812, and the prisoners refused to accept the bread
sent in by the contractor, the whole prison went without food for
twenty-four hours.&nbsp; The starving Romans fell upon the offal
heaps as usual, and when the two-horse waggon came in to remove
the filth, they resented the removal of their larder.&nbsp; In
the course of the dispute, partly to revenge themselves upon the
driver, partly to appease their famishing blood thirst, these
wretches fell upon the horses with knives, stabbed them to death,
and fastened their teeth in the bleeding carcases.&nbsp; This
horror was too much for the stomachs of the other prisoners, who
helped to drive them off.</p>
<p>Occasionally the administration made an attempt to clothe
them.&nbsp; In April 1813, fourteen who were entitled to a fresh
issue were caught, scrubbed from head to foot in the bath-house,
deprived of their filthy rags, and properly clothed, but on the
very next day they had sold every garment, and were again seen in
the yards with nothing to cover their nakedness but the
threadbare blanket common to the tenants of the
&ldquo;Capitole.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1812 they were banished to No. 4
prison, and in order to keep them from annoying their fellow
prisoners the walls were built which separated No. 4 and its yard
from the rest of the prison, for it was hoped that where all were
destitute, those who would sell their clothing, bedding and
provisions would be unable to find a purchaser.&nbsp; But though
new hammocks and clothing were given to them by charitable French
prisoners as well as by the Government, <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>they
disposed of them all through the bars of the gate and went naked
as before.</p>
<p>Unquestionably, the greatest evil which Captain Cotgrave was
called upon to face was the sale of rations.&nbsp; Serious crime
could safely be left to the prisoners themselves to punish, but
this inhuman traffic was the business of nobody but the persons
who indulged in it.</p>
<p>Each prisoner was served with rations every day, but if he
chose to sell them instead of eating them, it was very difficult
to interfere.&nbsp; Certain prisoners set up shops where they
bought the rations of the improvident and sold them again at a
profit.&nbsp; Gambling, of course, was at the bottom of the
evil.&nbsp; To get a penny or two to stake at the tables, men who
had sold all their clothes would hypothecate their rations for
several days, and, having lost, and knowing that to beg would be
useless, they would sit down to starve, until, in the last stage
of weakness, they were carried to the infirmary to die.&nbsp;
Sometimes these miserable creatures would forestall the end by
hanging themselves to a hammock stanchion, rather than be forced
out of their beds by the guards.</p>
<p>In February 1813, very much to their surprise, Captain
Cotgrave clapped a few of the most notorious food buyers into the
<i>Cachot</i>, and kept them there for ten days, on two-thirds
allowance.&nbsp; To their remonstrances he replied as
follows:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>To the
Prisoners in the Cachot for Purchasing Provisions</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orders to put you on short allowance from the
Commissioners of His Majesty&rsquo;s Transport Board is for
purchasing the provisions of your fellow prisoners, by which
means numbers have died from want of food, and the hospital is
filled with sick not likely to recover.&nbsp; The number of
deaths occasioned by this inhuman practice occasions considerable
expense to the Government, <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>not only in coffins, but the
hospital filled with those poor unhappy wretches so far reduced
from want of food that they linger a considerable time in the
hospital at the Government&rsquo;s expense, and then fall a
victim to the cruelty of those who have purchased their
provisions to the disgrace of Christians and whatever nation they
belong to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The testimony of your countrymen and the surgeons prove
the fact.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it was all to no purpose, and in the following month we
find him appealing to the whole body of prisoners.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Notice to the
Prisoners in General</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The infamous and horrible practice of a certain number
of prisoners who buy the provisions of some evil-conducted and
unfortunate of their fellow-countrymen, thereby tearing away from
them the only means of existence they possess forces me to
forewarn the whole of the prisoners that on the first appearance
of a recurrence of this odious and abominable practice I shall,
without any exception prevent any person from keeping shops in
the prison, and I will stop the market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it would be entirely against my wishes and
inclination to have recourse to these violent measures, I
strongly request of the well-conducted of the prisoners to use
all their exertions to put a stop thereto.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The threat was an empty one; the well-conducted prisoners
discountenanced the practice, but the Romans bought and sold
among themselves.</p>
<p>After their attack upon the American prisoners in July 1813,
they were further isolated, by being confined to the small yard
on the south side of No. 4 (now the separate cells yard).&nbsp;
For more than four years they had skulked about the yards by day,
almost naked, <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>exposed to the damp fogs of summer and the icy blasts
of winter; had huddled by night upon a wet and filthy stone
floor, had subsisted half-starved upon garbage until the wind
seemed to blow through their skeleton ribs; had neglected every
elementary law of sanitation, and yet, strange to relate, every
succeeding epidemic had passed them by, and it was notorious
throughout the prison that sickness was almost unknown among the
Romans.&nbsp; When General Stephenson and Mr. Hawker held their
inquiry in 1813, the scandal of their mode of life was so great
that the principal recommendation of the Commission was that
&ldquo;the prisoners calling themselves Romans&rdquo; should be
removed and compelled to live like human beings in some place
where they could be kept under strict surveillance.&nbsp; And so,
on October 16th, 1813, the scarecrow battalion of 436
&ldquo;Romans&rdquo; was mustered at the gate, decently clothed,
and marched under a strong escort to a prison hulk in Plymouth,
and kept under strict discipline until the peace.&nbsp; Fit
products of the Terror these Romans, who as children may have
hooted after the tumbrils in Paris, and shrieked with unholy glee
as the boats went down in the Noyades under the quai at
Nantes.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there no Peace for

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Lord

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a relief to turn over the
last page of the chapter which illustrates the darkest side of
the prison&rsquo;s history, and to pass on to the consideration
of what probably was the greatest solace which those in
confinement experienced.&nbsp; This was work.&nbsp; Not the work
done daily by the fatigue parties, but work by which the
prisoners could earn something.&nbsp; By far the largest amount
of the earnings was money brought into the prison from without,
of which a portion circulated in the prison, finding remunerative
work for other inmates.&nbsp; Much was spent in the market, and
again left the prison, but a considerable amount accumulated in
the hands of the thrifty, and sent the prisoners back to their
own country all the richer for having been in Norman Cross.</p>
<p>Although remunerative is as a rule more attractive than
unremunerative work, any work done by the prisoners must have
been cheering and elevating to those condemned to the deadly
monotony of an idle prison life.&nbsp; To those gifted with
artistic taste, the production of the thousands of specimens of
beautiful and ingenious articles of value must have been a
positive joy.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>The
work open to the industrious prisoners included that of an
ordinary labourer, of a skilled artisan, and of a man with a
trade, and ranged up to that of a teacher, an actor, an author,
or an artist!</p>
<p>A complaint of the French Government was that the British did
not employ their prisoners on works outside the walls, as the
British were employed in France.&nbsp; The answer to this is that
the French male labour market was exhausted by the serious
depletion due to conscription of the adult male population, and
that the French Government, in the interests of France, gladly
availed itself of the services of the British, under military
surveillance, for public works, etc.&nbsp; No such necessity
pressed on the British; there was an ample supply of labour, and
the introduction of competing gangs of prisoners of war would
have led to trouble, and was in fact a domestic
impossibility.&nbsp; There were occasions when the prisoners were
employed on large constructive works connected with their own
prisons.&nbsp; Dartmoor Chapel was built by the prisoners in
1810&ndash;14; the masons were paid 6<i>d.</i> a day, it being
understood that the money should accumulate, and that should any
workman escape, the whole of the pay due to the gang would be
forfeited.&nbsp; By this means every prisoner was made a warder
over his fellows. <a name="citation125"></a><a
href="#footnote125" class="citation">[125]</a></p>
<p>They were also regularly employed in their prisons as
labourers, and those who knew a trade as tradesmen.&nbsp; From
the accounts of Norman Cross Prison (which are scattered among
various bundles, and difficult to find) has been selected the
wage sheet for the midsummer quarter of 1789.&nbsp; The total is
&pound;408 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; of this &pound;13 7<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> was paid to the Dutch, and &pound;32 to the French
prisoners employed as labourers.&nbsp; Under the head of
tradesmen&rsquo;s bills for the same quarter are entered, French
prisoners &pound;35 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; Dutch prisoners
&pound;541 6<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>&nbsp; These sums represent the
employment of a considerable number <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>of men, as, the recipients being
lodged and fed at the expense of the State, the wage each man
received was very small, much below the normally low wage paid
for labour at that date.&nbsp; The accounts show that the
practice of employing and paying the prisoners was in vogue in
the first years of the Depot&rsquo;s existence, and that it went
on until its last year is shown in the report of Mr. William
Fearnall, the surveyor, <a name="citation126"></a><a
href="#footnote126" class="citation">[126]</a> who recommends
certain repairs, and states that Captain Hanwell, the Agent, can
find thirty-six carpenters, two pairs of sawyers, and three
masons from among the prisoners.&nbsp; Further, as already
stated, the prisoners held several paid posts, such as cooks,
nurses, hospital porters, and the like, within the prison
walls.</p>

<p>In the sketch of the prison life, allusion has been made to
the retail traders and merchants; there were also
craftsmen&mdash;men who knew a trade&mdash;tailors, shoemakers,
cooks, etc.&nbsp; These carried on a business, their customers
being their fellow prisoners.&nbsp; The regulation made for the
protection of the revenue and in the interests of our own
workers, to the effect that in making slippers and shoes, they
might use list, but no leather, must have applied only to
articles made for sale outside.&nbsp; The employments by which
the prisoners earned money from outside and brought it into the
prison have, perhaps, the greatest interest to us.&nbsp; The
greater part of this money was either transmitted for safe
keeping to France or Holland, banked with the agent, or hoarded
until the hoped-for day of release should come.</p>
<p>The industry, neatness of fingers, skill and artistic taste of
the prisoners, enabled them to produce a great variety of
ornamental and useful articles.&nbsp; The materials used in these
manufactures were usually very simple, but it has puzzled writers
on the subject to account for the possession by the prisoners of
the dyes with which they stained the straws used in their
brightly coloured <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>and delicately tinted marquetry decorative work.&nbsp;
One writer or imaginative person started the theory that the
colours were all obtained from the tea served out to the
prisoners, and this has been repeated in various literary notices
on this subject, in magazines, newspapers, and other
documents.&nbsp; The reader may be spared the effort of trying to
account for the loss of the art of extracting such colours from
such a source, by recognising the fact that no tea was served out
to a prisoner, except to those in the hospital, and that it would
be far cheaper for the prisoners to buy the dyes in the outside
market than to purchase tea&mdash;which was at that time a costly
article used only by persons with good incomes&mdash;from which
to extract these mythical dyes.</p>
<p>An entry in the diary of Archdeacon Strong, to whose model of
the Block House allusion has already been made, suggests that the
work was often bespoken, and that the dyes and other more
expensive materials may have been paid for beforehand by the
purchaser.&nbsp; The entry is: &ldquo;23rd October
1801&mdash;Drove Margaret to y<sup>e</sup> Barracks.&nbsp; Bought
the model of the Block House and provided the Mahogany.&nbsp;
&pound;1 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, sergt. 1<i>s.</i>, man
1<i>s.</i>, soldier 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; The
venerable gentleman&rsquo;s diary contains other items throwing
light on the price received by the prisoners for the fruit of
their labours.&nbsp; From one such entry we learn that the
Archdeacon, in 1811, paid two guineas for a marquetry picture of
the Minster, now the property of his grandson, Colonel
Strong.</p>
<p>The straw undoubtedly was bought from outside, and there can
be no doubt that what applied to this &ldquo;raw product&rdquo;
applied to other material and to tools necessary for the
production of the works, by the sale of which we have
Commissioner Serle&rsquo;s authority for the prevalent opinion
that within a few years of their confinement many of the
prisoners had made one hundred guineas.</p>
<p>The great speciality of the Norman Cross prisoners <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>was straw
marquetry work, in which they greatly excelled, producing
beautiful pictures in straw, and manufacturing and decorating
with varied, elaborate, and most artistic designs, cabinets,
work-boxes, desks, tea-caddies, dressing-boxes, small boxes of
various shapes, hand fire-screens, snuff-boxes, silk holders,
etc., etc.&nbsp; It would appear that occasionally the prisoners,
skilled in this work, were applied to, to decorate with their
marquetry, articles such as picture frames, etc.&nbsp; There have
recently been presented to the museum of the Peterborough Natural
History and Antiquarian Society, by a friend, through Mr. C.
Dack, the Curator, fourteen examples of straw marquetry work,
among them a case containing a telescope which was bought at the
sale of Captain John Kelly, son of Major Kelly, the last
Brigade-Major at the barracks.&nbsp; This resembles an ordinary
telescope, except that the tube is covered by straw marquetry,
the work of a prisoner, instead of the usual leather casing.</p>

<p>The illustrations, which are reproductions of very perfect
photographs taken by Mr. A. C. Taylor of articles in the museum,
show more convincingly than any verbal description can, the
beauty of the designs and the workmanship of the most artistic of
these articles, although they fail to show the colour effects
produced by the use of dyed straws.</p>
<p>In all there are in the museum 162 examples of straw work,
almost all of them being marquetry.&nbsp; There is one straw
bonnet which was found in the roof of a house at Cottesmore,
twenty-five miles from Norman Cross.&nbsp; How it is identified
as Norman Cross work the author does not know, but if made at
Norman Cross, it was probably carried away surreptitiously by a
smuggler and hidden until a safe opportunity for its sale offered
itself.&nbsp; The manufacture in the prison of hats and bonnets
was forbidden.</p>
<p>Returning to the legitimate and more artistic work <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>of the
prisoners, it may be mentioned that the joinery and
cabinet-makers&rsquo; work of the various articles made for
decoration by the straw workers, most of it, as it is believed
done in the prison, was of the best quality, and has made a
durable base for the straw marquetry with which the experts
overlaid them, in beautiful formal patterns with delicately
coloured designs, human figures, birds, flowers, etc.,
interspersed.&nbsp; Pictures on panel, in the same material, are
also found in private houses in the neighbourhood, but the most
beautiful are now in the museum.&nbsp; One, a view of the west
front of Peterborough Cathedral, bearing the name De la Porte as
the artist who constructed it, has been already mentioned, and in
the course of the researches made for the purpose of this
history, the owner of the name has been identified with Corporal
Jean De la Porte, one of the French heroes who on the 12th
October 1805 fought against the British at Trafalgar, where
Nelson died, but not before he had settled the question of our
nation&rsquo;s supremacy on the sea.&nbsp; J. De la Porte was
taken in <i>L&rsquo;Intr&eacute;pide</i>. <a
name="citation129"></a><a href="#footnote129"
class="citation">[129]</a></p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Another manufacture carried on very extensively by the
prisoners was bone work, the cooking-houses afforded the
material, and in the Peterborough Museum alone are 256 examples
of the work produced by the skill and industry of the prisoners
in their manipulation of the bones of the animals which were
killed for their ration (of these 256 articles, 33 were the gift
of Mr. C. Dack&rsquo;s friend already referred to).&nbsp; With
this material and the simplest tools were produced works, as a
rule, more crude and of less artistic design than the works of
the marquetry artists, but demanding skill, delicacy of touch,
and untiring patience on the part of the artificer, who must in
some instances have spent months and even years over their
execution.&nbsp; Such a work was that represented in the
illustration.&nbsp; It appears to represent a stage, on which are
placed various figures.</p>

<p>The largest specimen in the museum of this class of work is
the model of a large ch&acirc;teau, with various mechanically
working figures.&nbsp; It was presented by H. L. C. Brassey,
M.P., on the recommendation of Mr. C. Dack, the curator of the
museum, who says that he has evidence of its authenticity as a
work of the Norman Cross prisoners.&nbsp; There are nine
beautiful models of ships, most elaborate models of the
guillotine (Plate X, p. 102), crowded with little carved figures
of soldiers, the victim, the executioner, etc.; watch-stands,
domino boxes, many elaborately carved, a domino and cribbage box

<p>The group of figures on a platform (Plate XVI, Fig. 1), is one
of many such mechanical toys or ornaments <a

the lower wheel below the platform is turned, by an arrangement
of the threads passing over the wheels, the various figures move,
the lady in the centre turns the winding-wheel, the child moves
forward, the soldier and the lady waltz, the mother tosses her
baby, turning her head to look at it, while the lady on the left
prepares the tea.&nbsp; The owner of this ornament is the
grandson of its purchaser.</p>
<p>Some of the bone articles have parts that have been turned;
one of the minor exhibits is a pair of turned cribbage
pegs.&nbsp; This work does not prove that there was a lathe in
the prison.&nbsp; The prisoner who made the carved cribbage box
would easily get the turned pegs finished off outside.</p>
<p>Another material in which the prisoners worked was horn, but
the examples are few.&nbsp; H. Akin, late Secretary of the
Society of Arts, writing on &ldquo;Horn and
Tortoise-shell,&rdquo; <a name="citation131a"></a><a
href="#footnote131a" class="citation">[131a]</a> says,
&ldquo;Another branch of industry practised by the prisoners was
horn work, and here again the artistic ingenuity of the French
was manifest at Norman Cross.&nbsp; (The solid tips were made
into handles, buttons, ornaments, etc.)&nbsp; Of the long pieces,
after certain processes the principal uses were for combs, the
chief manufactury of which was at Kenilworth, but combs
ornamented with open work were not made in England, on account of
the expense, being imported in great quantities from
France.&rdquo; <a name="citation131b"></a><a href="#footnote131b"
class="citation">[131b]</a>&nbsp; The passage quoted shows that
at the date it was written (1840) the Norman Cross bone work was
well known.&nbsp; The specimens in the Museum are very few; they
include horn fans, three <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>of which were a part of the gift of
Mr. Dack&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>Of articles made from wood there are but few in the
museum.&nbsp; The most important is a beautifully carved figure
of a Roman warrior, 11 inches high on a bone carved pedestal;
others are models of the Block House (Plate III, p. 22), models
of ships, domino and other boxes, and one wooden block with the
name Louis Charti&eacute;e (<i>sic</i>) carved in relief.&nbsp;
This will be referred to later on.&nbsp; It will be remembered
that M. Charretie (whose name was not always spelt correctly,
even in official documents) was the commissary for the French
prisoners in England in the early days of Norman Cross.</p>

</a></p>
<p>One other material in which the French prisoners worked was
paper.&nbsp; It was used to make artificial flowers, and there
are two examples in the museum (Plate XVI, Fig. 2).&nbsp; One, a
group representing roses, sweet peas, passion flowers, a most
valuable specimen, was among the gifts of Mr. C. Dack&rsquo;s
friend; the other (Plate XVI, Fig. 3) was presented by the late
Dr. L. Cane of Peterborough, and has an authentic history.&nbsp;
Another form in which paper was used was its application in
strips, one eighth of an inch wide, of stiff, gold-edged or
coloured paper, to a surface prepared with flanges, projecting to
the exact width of the strip; the latter was wound on its cut
edge in a pattern of graceful curves, the cut edge being glued to
the wood or other material forming the base and the gilt edge
being left on the surface.&nbsp; In order to complete the
pattern, the interstices left between the convolutions were at
various parts of the design filled with solidly rolled strips of
coloured paper, giving the appearance of cloisonn&eacute;e work;
at other parts a different device was adopted to give variety, a
plate of tinfoil, cut to the shape of a leaf or other pattern,
was fixed on the foundation before the coils of paper were glued
to it, the <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>reflection giving the appearance of mother-of-pearl. <a
name="citation133a"></a><a href="#footnote133a"
class="citation">[133a]</a>&nbsp; A pair of wine slides and a box
are the only specimens of the work in the museum, but three other
examples, all of them tea-caddies, are known to the writer. <a
name="citation133b"></a><a href="#footnote133b"
class="citation">[133b]</a></p>
<p>The collection in the Peterborough Museum embraces 450
articles manufactured by the prisoners of war, but possibly not
all at Norman Cross.&nbsp; It is probably the largest and finest
collection in the world, although the model of the Norman Cross
Depot in the Mus&eacute;e de l&rsquo;Arm&eacute;e, H&ocirc;tel
des Invalides, Paris, excels, both in its size and in the
multiplicity of its detail, any one object in the Peterborough
Museum.&nbsp; A photograph of this beautiful model (Plate XX, p.
251) is reproduced in the final chapter of this work, where it
naturally finds a place, as it represents the departure of the
first detachment of the freed prisoners at the final closing of
the Depot.&nbsp; The size of the model will be appreciated from
the measurements of each of the caserns, which are as follows:
length 169 millimetres, approximately 7 inches; width 70
millimetres, approximately 3 inches; height, from ground to eave,
9 centimetres, approximately 4&frac12; inches.</p>
<p>The workers in straw did not confine their attention to these
works of art, they also manufactured straw <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>hats and
bonnets, although this handicraft was forbidden from the earliest
years of the prison&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; The manufacture of
straw plait was not forbidden until a later date.&nbsp; There was
good reason for these interdicts.&nbsp; This branch of trade was
a staple industry of the neighbouring counties of Bedford and
Hertford, and to a less extent of Huntingdonshire and
Northamptonshire, and the prisoners who were fed by the State
were competing on advantageous terms with those who had to
contribute to their maintenance, but, worse than this, in the
eyes of the Government, they were actually defrauding the
Revenue.&nbsp; As the war continued year after year, fresh
articles had to be taxed to find the funds for carrying it
on.&nbsp; In his Budget speech on 5th April 1802, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer alluded to the Schedule of 5,000 articles liable
to duty. <a name="citation134a"></a><a href="#footnote134a"
class="citation">[134a]</a>&nbsp; Among these were straw hats and
bonnets. <a name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b"
class="citation">[134b]</a></p>
<p>Various accounts have been given of the part which was taken
by the outside accomplices of the prisoners, some speaking of
their smuggling the plait in, and others of their smuggling it
out.&nbsp; That they did smuggle in &ldquo;the Straw Manufactured
for the purpose of being made into Hats, Bonnets, etc., by which
the Revenue of our country is injured, and the poor who exist by
that branch of trade would be turned out of employ,&rdquo; is
proved by Sir Rupert George&rsquo;s letter, <a
name="citation134c"></a><a href="#footnote134c"
class="citation">[134c]</a> printed in a report to the House of
Commons.&nbsp; In this letter the Commissioner of the Transport
Office goes on to say, &ldquo;I must observe that this, the
manufactured straw plait is the only article which the prisoners
are prevented from manufacturing.&rdquo;&nbsp; This letter is
dated 19th <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>March 1808; its discovery destroys an illusion which
the inscription publicly displayed in the Town of Luton, beneath
Mr. Arthur Cooke&rsquo;s beautiful picture, would establish, if
its historical accuracy were not disproved.</p>
<p>The picture hangs in the Free Library of Luton, with the
following inscription attached:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Plait Merchants trading with the French
Prisoners of War at Yaxley 1806&ndash;1815.&nbsp; Painted by A.
C. Cooke.&nbsp; Presented to the Town of Luton by J. C. Kershaw,
Esq.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In those years, Sir Rupert George&rsquo;s letter, which only
came to light in 1909, after the picture was painted, proves
(without further evidence) that the trade was illicit, that no
such open dealing could have taken place at that time, that it
was an underground trade, carried on by the help of middlemen and
outside accomplices. <a name="citation135"></a><a
href="#footnote135" class="citation">[135]</a>&nbsp; The
gesticulating Frenchman and the keen, critical merchant at that
time never met; between the one in the prison and the other miles
away came the old woman, to be mentioned directly, and others
like her.&nbsp; Soldiers, the guards of the mail coaches,
innkeepers, <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>hostlers, and tradesmen in Stilton and elsewhere were
not above purchasing the smuggled goods and disposing of them to
the Luton merchants.</p>

<p>The existence of Macgregor&rsquo;s plan of the Depot, and
various documents examined in the Record Office, also show that
the date affixed to the picture makes it an historical
anachronism, the market in the years named being held
<i>outside</i> the brick wall surrounding the prison, out of
sight of any stockade fencing, and with permanent stalls of brick
and slate built against the wall in the eastern embrasure.&nbsp;
In the earlier days of the Depot&rsquo;s existence, although the
sale of straw hats and bonnets was forbidden, such a scene as
that depicted might possibly have been witnessed.&nbsp; Mr. Cooke
will doubtless insist on the prompt alteration of the dates in
the inscription describing the picture.</p>
<p>The artist has kindly permitted the writer to introduce here a
photogravure of this work of art.&nbsp; The typical figures alive
on the canvas each telling its own tale, the beautiful grouping,
and the background in which they are placed, present to the eye
of the reader what this work strives to convey to his mind in
words.&nbsp; An artist&rsquo;s licence doubtless sanctions the
introduction of a tree, the light open-paled fence, instead of
the stockade posts and other minor details which conflict with
the precise ideas arrived at by the writer, who feels constrained
to notice these little inaccuracies.</p>

<p>On the 18th March 1806 the House of Commons resolved to go
into committee to consider the question of charging a duty on
imported straw plait.&nbsp; After formal stages, it was resolved,
26th June, to levy a duty <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>of 7<i>s.</i> per lb. avoirdupois of
plaiting for hats or bonnets, &pound;1 16<i>s.</i> on every dozen
hats or bonnets not exceeding 22 inches in diameter, &pound;3
12<i>s.</i> on every dozen exceeding 22 inches in diameter.&nbsp;
The Act received the royal assent on the 10th July.&nbsp; After
this date the sale of straw plait was interdicted as had
previously been the sale of hats, the hats and the plait made at
Norman Cross being alike regarded as foreign productions and
liable to tax.</p>
<p>In official documents constant reference is made to this
traffic in the plait as illegal and defrauding the Revenue.</p>
<p>George Borrow&rsquo;s eloquent description of &ldquo;the straw
plait hunts&rdquo; (poor little ten-year-old George
Borrow&mdash;his sympathetic soul went out to the captives!) has
helped to throw the glamour of romance over the irregular
proceedings of the Frenchmen, whom we were maintaining in our
prisons, and whom we would gladly have restored to their own
country if only we could be met on fair terms.</p>
<p>Persons in the neighbourhood, soldiers from the barracks, and
others were accessories in the illicit trade in straw
plait.&nbsp; They would conceal it about their persons, wrap it
round their bodies, etc.&nbsp; They assisted in two ways, they
helped to get the straw into the prison and to carry the
manufactured article out. <a name="citation137"></a><a
href="#footnote137" class="citation">[137]</a></p>
<p>Although the interdict on the traffic was issued even before
the articles were taxed, in the interests of the trade and of the
workers in the district, so profitable was the illicit traffic to
those who took part in it, that the fact that they were
interfering with the living of their own countrymen and women had
no deterrent effect, and such was the influence of the merchants
<a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>and the
various persons in the neighbourhood engaged in the trade that it
was difficult to get convictions.&nbsp; To get the straw ready
cut into proper lengths into the hands of the prisoners was
doubtless more easy than to get a sack of straw thrown over the
prison wall, carried across the open spaces up to the inner
stockade fence, and again thrown over them into the court of the
caserns.&nbsp; This proceeding must have needed several soldier
accomplices, some giving active assistance and others closing
their eyes to what was going on.&nbsp; These men, when detected,
had severe punishment, receiving as many as 500 lashes.&nbsp;
Three civilians tried at Huntingdon for being engaged in the
traffic in 1811 were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, one
for twelve and the two others for six months.</p>
<p>That the trade in straw plait was an extensive one, and that
the prisoners effected an improvement both in the character of
the plait and the method of producing it, are almost universally
accepted facts.&nbsp; In Davis&rsquo; <i>History of Luton</i>,
pp. 152&ndash;3, is a small section which, although written under
the mistaken conception that the French prisoners were at Norman
Cross only about eight years&mdash;1806&ndash;14&mdash;and that
the merchants during that period went to the barracks to purchase
the plait, is probably correct in saying that the trade is
indebted to these prisoners for the invention of the simple
machine for splitting the straw from which such great and
beautiful varieties of plait are made.&nbsp; There are two
descriptions of machines called splitters.</p>
<p>The writer of an article in <i>Chambers&rsquo; Journal</i>, <a
name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a> after instancing industries introduced
at various places where they were confined by the prisoners of
war, such as the knitting worsted gloves at Chesterfield, goes on
to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At Norman Cross they revolutionised the
straw <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>plaiting trade.&nbsp; Up to their time the straw was
plaited whole and called &lsquo;Dunstable,&rsquo; but it was a
case of necessity being the mother of invention.&nbsp; Their
supply not being equal to the demand, one of them invented the
&lsquo;splitter.&rsquo;&nbsp; This consists of a small wheel,
inserted in a mahogany frame, and furnished in the centre with
small sharp divisions like spokes.&nbsp; From the axle a small
spike protrudes, on which a straw pipe is placed and pushed
through, the cutters or spokes dividing it into as many strips as
required.&nbsp; By this contrivance the plait could be made much
finer, the strips could be used alternately with the outside and
inside, or even the inside alone, which is white, and is known in
the trade as &lsquo;rice&rsquo; straw.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a full description of this little implement called the
splitter, the reader is referred to the article, &ldquo;Straw
Plaiting and French Prisoners,&rdquo; by Maberly Phillips,
F.S.A., <i>The Connoisseur</i>, vol. xxvii., No. 105.</p>
<p>There are in the Peterborough Museum three examples of
different varieties of straw splitters.&nbsp; The neat splitting
of the straw was possibly not an invention of the prisoners,
although it may have come from France.&nbsp; If it were, it is
likely that it was not originally contrived for the manufacture
of straw plait, but for the straw used in the marquetry, for
which purpose it had to be most carefully prepared, and much of
it dyed, with material bought in the market.</p>
<p>From the first opening of the prison, straw work was carried
on, although in going through the copy in the Record Office of
the register of deaths of those who died in the prison, the late
Mr. W. B. Sands, Secretary to the association
&ldquo;L&rsquo;entente cordiale,&rdquo; and Mrs. Sands, the
present acting Secretary, found that very few of the prisoners,
whose names and native places were there entered, came from
districts in France where this industry was prevalent.&nbsp; So
long as the work was confined <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>to ornamental articles, which paid
no import duty, it was allowed, but as early as June 1798 an
order was issued prohibiting the introduction of any more straw
for the manufacture of hats, and ten years later, in June 1808,
there is a record that the general market was put under severe
restrictions owing to the illicit traffic in straw.&nbsp; This
restriction evidently pressed harshly upon the marquetry workers,
for we find, on the 11th November 1808, a letter from the
Admiralty Board, saying that &ldquo;If the manufacture of
<i>Plait</i> could be effectually prevented, it is not our wish
to prohibit the Prisoners from making baskets, boxes, or such
like articles of straw.&nbsp; The Prisoners might purchase wool
and make frocks, for their own use; if any should be sold, a stop
was to be put to the manufacture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 20th March 1809 a shop was opened for each building,
with two prisoners as salesmen, all articles being marked with
the price and the owner&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; The salesmen were to
be searched going and returning, and if any prohibited article
were found, the shops were to be closed.&nbsp; In July of the
same year, notwithstanding the precautions, the illicit traffic
was so rampant that stringent orders were issued to entirely
close one quadrangle for a month.&nbsp; This was in consequence
of the Admiralty having intercepted a letter enclosing a
&pound;10 bill, the proceeds of a sale at Thame of illicit
articles made by the prisoners at Norman Cross.</p>
<p>The sympathies of the outside public appear to have been with
those who made the plait and those who sold it contrary to the
law, as was usually the case in the districts on the coast where
smugglers carried on their trade.&nbsp; The number of those
actually engaged in the traffic and making profit out of it was
no doubt very considerable.&nbsp; A trial which took place at
Huntingdon in 1811 shows the number of hands through which a
packet of plait went before it reached the Luton bonnet <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>makers.&nbsp; Four Stilton men, one the ostler at the
Bell Inn, who had acted as intermediaries between the Luton
merchants and the prisoners, had bribed the soldier who came in
contact with the prisoners to take packets of straw cut to the
proper length into the prison, and to bring the manufactured
plait out; they were all four convicted and punished.&nbsp;
Whether the soldier, who was acting in defiance of a special
order by the Duke of York, escaped punishment is not known; they
were paid by the Stilton men a shilling for getting the straw in
and another for getting the plait out.&nbsp; The merchants, no
doubt, took care to escape the hands of the law.</p>

<p>In <i>The Stamford Mercury</i> of 12th February 1812 are
related the particulars of an outrage on Sergeant Ives of the
West Essex Militia at that time stationed at the Depot.&nbsp; He
was stopped between Stilton and Norman Cross by a number of men,
knocked down and robbed of his watch and money, his jaws were
wrenched open and a piece of his tongue cut off.&nbsp; It was
said that the sergeant had been active in stopping the plait
trade and that this led to the outrage.&nbsp; Another possible
explanation of this outrage is suggested in a later chapter on
the health of the prisoners.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Moulins, of whom more shortly, was living at
Stilton, and although he has been raised by tradition to a very
exalted position of righteousness, he got into trouble by
allowing his servant to become an outside agent for those engaged
in this illicit traffic.&nbsp; The good Bishop applied to the
Government for another young prisoner to take the place of Jean
Baptiste David, and, his request being refused, he pressed into
his service the intercession of Lord Fitzwilliam, who had already
befriended him in other ways.&nbsp; The letter from Mr.
Commissioner George, to the Secretary to the First Lord of the
Admiralty, throws light not only on the particular case of the
Bishop, but on this question of the straw <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>plait
manufacture in general, and it is therefore transcribed at length
in the text.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Transport Office</span>,<br />
&ldquo;19<i>th March</i> 1808.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;In answer to what is stated in Lord Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s
letter to Lord Mulgrave, I request you will inform His Lordship
that the Bishop of Moulins was introduced to me by the Bishop of
Montpellier, and at his request I prevailed on my colleagues to
release a Prisoner of War from Norman Cross Prison, to attend
upon him; this I am sorry to acknowledge was irregular and
unauthorised, but I was actuated by motives of humanity as the
Bishop complained that his finances were so limited, that he
could not afford to keep any servant of a different
description.&nbsp; This should have influenced the Bishop to keep
his servant from carrying on any improper traffic with the
Prisoners; on the contrary he became the instrument of
introducing straw manufactured to the prisoners, for the purpose
of being made into hats, bonnets, etc., by which the Revenue of
our country is injured, and the poor who exist by that branch of
trade would be turned out of employment, as the Prisoners who are
fed, clothed, and lodged at the public expense would be able to
undersell them.&nbsp; I must observe that this is the only
article which the Prisoners are prevented from
manufacturing.&nbsp; When the Bishop&rsquo;s servant had
established himself in their trade, the Bishop wrote to me that
he had found means of getting his livelihood and desired he might
remain at large, and that another prisoner might be released to
serve him, neither of which the Board thought proper to comply
with, for the foregoing reasons, upon which the Bishop of Moulins
complained to the Admiralty, who directed us to give such answer
as the case called for.&nbsp; I have only to add that the Bishop
experienced greater indulgence from us than any other French <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>Ecclesiastic ever did, to which, in my opinion, he has
not made an adequate return, nor felt himself, as he ought to
have done, answerable for the conduct of his servant, and if a
strict discipline is not maintained in the prisons, as the
prisoners are daily increasing the consequences may be
incalculable,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I am, Dear Sir,<br />
&ldquo;Very faithfully yours,<br />

<p>&ldquo;Captain Morson.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was George Borrow who, in the third chapter of
<i>Lavengro</i>, published in 1851, reintroduced the Norman Cross
Depot to the British public.&nbsp; A generation had passed away
since the buildings were rased to the ground, and of the living
inhabitants of these islands, only a very few knew that such a
place had ever existed.</p>
<p>In the striking passage, which has been quoted in full in a
former chapter, page 33, Borrow conveyed the impression that
&ldquo;England, in general so kind and bountiful,&rdquo; was
guilty of disgraceful conduct in her treatment of the French
prisoners, and that the suppression of the illicit straw-plait
trade was associated with ruthless inroads into the prison
accompanied by acts of callous cruelty.</p>
<p>George Borrow&rsquo;s father, Thomas Borrow, a Lieutenant in
the West Norfolk Militia, was quartered at Norman Cross from July
1811 to April 1813.&nbsp; His little son George, born in 1803,
spent his ninth and tenth years in the barracks, and in those
years he received the impressions which led him to publish this
passage forty years later.</p>
<p>By a curious coincidence the agent, who, during the two years
in which the child was making his personal observations,
practically ruled the Depot, and carried out the necessary steps
to suppress the traffic in straw plait, had his record cut in
stone at the actual time <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>when the events recorded in
<i>Lavengro</i> took place.&nbsp; On the wall of St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church, Yaxley, is a marble tablet with this
legend:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Inscribed at the desire and the sole
expense of the French Prisoners of War at Norman Cross to the
memory of Captain John Draper, who for the last eighteen months
of his life was Agent to the Depot, in testimony of their esteem
and gratitude for his humane attention to their comfort during
that too short period, he died Feb. 23, 1813, aged 53
years.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was ever a calumny more absolutely disproved than is this
aspersion of George Borrow&rsquo;s upon the fair fame of his
country, by the testimony of the very persons whom he said she
had maltreated and whose evidence, cut in stone at their desire
and sole expense at the very time the boy was in the barracks,
appeals to us from that marble slab?</p>
<p>This manufacture of straw plait went on not only at Norman
Cross, but in the other prisons, the manufacturers being no doubt
assisted by all their comrades in captivity to elude the efforts
of the authorities to stop the traffic.&nbsp; The following
amusing incident, narrated in Penny&rsquo;s <i>Traditions of
Perth</i>, is retold by Mr. William Sievwright: <a
name="citation144"></a><a href="#footnote144"
class="citation">[144]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As much straw plait as made a bonnet was
sold for four shillings, and being exceedingly neat it was much
enquired after.&nbsp; In this trade many a one got a bite, for
the straw was all made up in parcels, and smuggled into the
pockets of purchasers for fear of detection.&nbsp; The following
is an instance of the manner in which the prisoners practised
their deceptions.&nbsp; An unsuspecting man having been induced
by his wife to purchase a quantity of straw plait for a bonnet,
he attended the <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>market, and soon found a merchant; he paid the money,
but lest he should be observed, he turned about his back to the
seller and got the thing slipped into his hand, and then into his
pocket.&nbsp; Away he went with his parcel, well pleased that he
had escaped detection.&nbsp; On his way he thought he would
examine his purchase, when, to his astonishment, and no doubt his
deep mortification, he found instead of straw plait, a bundle of
shavings very neatly tied up.&nbsp; The man instantly returned
and charged the prisoners with the deception and insisted on
getting back his money, but the man could not be seen from where
the purchase was made.&nbsp; Whilst hanging on to catch a glimpse
of him, he was told that if he did not get away he would be
informed on and tried for buying the article.&nbsp; Seeing that
there was no chance of getting amends, he was retiring, when one
came forward and said he would find the man, and make him take
back the shavings, and get the money.&nbsp; Pretending deep
commiseration, the prisoner said he had no change, but if he
would give him sixteen shillings, he would give him a pound note
and take his chance of the man.&nbsp; The unfortunate
&lsquo;shavings&rsquo; dupe was simple enough to give the money
and take the note, thinking himself well off to get quit of his
purchase, but to his supreme chagrin he found the note to be a
well-executed forgery on the Perth Bank.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this story, what further need is there to seek evidence
of the cleverness, the versatility, the neat-handedness, and the
dexterity of the French prisoners!</p>
<p>In all the prisons, forgery of bank-notes was a business to
which the captives applied their skill, and the fate of two who
practised this art at Norman Cross has already been alluded
to.&nbsp; The straw plait industry, which probably originated at
Norman Cross, would be passed on with the transferred prisoners
to Perth and other prisons.&nbsp; Great embarrassment having
arisen <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>from the increase of French prisoners, who numbered in
1811 50,000 (Norman Cross being greatly overcrowded with nearly
7,000), the Depot at Perth was built, and in 1812 the first
prisoners were admitted.</p>
<p>As another instance of the frivolous character of the
complaints made by the French Government as to our treatment of
the prisoners, it may here be mentioned that the detention of
sailors in such a situation was made the subject of loud and
frequent complaint by the French Emperor, who said in the
<i>Moniteur</i> that &ldquo;by a refinement of cruelty the
English Government sends the French soldiers on board the hulks,
and the sailors into prisons in the interior of
Scotland.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alison alludes to this in his history, <a
name="citation146a"></a><a href="#footnote146a"
class="citation">[146a]</a> and in a footnote he adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The great Depot for French Prisoners in
Scotland, which Napoleon held out as so deplorable a place of
detention, was a noble edifice erected at a cost of nearly
&pound;100,000 in a beautiful and salubrious situation near Perth
on the Tay, which was in 1839 converted into a great central jail
for criminals.&nbsp; It contained 7,000 prisoners, and so healthy
was the situation, the lodging, and the fare, that the mortality,
only five or six annually, was less than the average for healthy
adults in Great Britain.&rdquo; <a name="citation146b"></a><a
href="#footnote146b" class="citation">[146b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the prisoners at Norman Cross were men who, before their
enrolment in the French or Dutch army or navy, were workers,
skilled in branches of industry unknown in England, and there is
a record that, on the 5th April 1808, the agent was instructed to
send a French prisoner, Louis F&eacute;lix Paris, to London, as
he was an expert in the &ldquo;ormolu business.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
meet the expense, two &pound;1 Bank of England notes were
sent.</p>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>The
application by the French prisoners at Norman Cross of their
skill to the felonious forging of bank-notes has already been
alluded to.&nbsp; So cleverly did they manage this, that it is
said, that the only way in which the forgery could be detected
was by wetting the notes and observing the different behaviour of
the ink used by them and that used by the printers of genuine
notes.</p>
<p>A writer in <i>All the Year Round</i> (1892, pp. 41&ndash;3)
remarks that &ldquo;when the &pound;1 note was introduced in the
last decade of the eighteenth century, forgery from the first was
the great trouble, and the hasty manner in which the notes were
engraved and issued greatly facilitated the operations of the
forger.&rdquo;&nbsp; In <i>The Bankers&rsquo; Magazine</i>, vol.
lxvii., pp. 390&ndash;410, <a name="citation147"></a><a
href="#footnote147" class="citation">[147]</a> is an article by
J. Macbeth Forbes, &ldquo;French Prisoners of War and Bank Note
Forging,&rdquo; in which is an illustration of a partially
executed forgery of a Guinea Note of the Bank of Scotland.&nbsp;
Another illustration is that of the words &ldquo;BANK OF
SCOTLAND&rdquo; carved on a bone by the prisoners in Edinburgh,
the letters measuring &#8542; inch, but so rough and irregular
are these, that, even if they were successfully reproduced, they
could hardly have deceived a simpleton, much less a Pawky
Scot.&nbsp; This block might have been an early effort to make a
tool for imitating the water-mark; the type is not reversed, so
it cannot have been a stamp for printing.&nbsp; It is possible,
however, that bone was the material used for type by the Norman
Cross forgers.&nbsp; The deft fingers which executed many of
their legitimate works of art were sufficiently skilled to carve
an imitation of a &pound;1 note.</p>
<p>The resemblance of the oak block with the name &ldquo;Louis
Chartie&rdquo; carved on it to that referred to in <i>The
Bankers&rsquo; Magazine</i>, suggests the possibility of its
having been a tool for one step in the process of forging M.
Charretie&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>The
fact that the prisoners were able to have in their possession,
and to use a plant and tools necessary for such a trade as
forging, illustrates the absence of any but a very casual
supervision of the thousands of prisoners concentrated in the
four courts of the prison.</p>
<p>One would gladly pass over another illegal traffic which was
with difficulty suppressed.&nbsp; To the disgrace of those
British purchasers whose depraved tastes made it worth the while
of the prisoners to expend their ingenuity on the production of
obscene pictures and carvings, it must be mentioned that an
illicit, secret trade in such articles was carried on at Norman
Cross.&nbsp; At one time in the year 1808 the trade in such
goods, clandestinely made and sold, reached such a pitch that
respectable inhabitants of the neighbourhood complained to the
Transport Commissioners, and on the 18th December an order was
issued totally closing the market.&nbsp; It was a severe
punishment, as it at once stopped the supply of all the little
necessaries, luxuries, and comforts the prisoners could
obtain&mdash;the vegetables, sugar, condiments, tobacco, beer,
clothing, which they were in the habit of purchasing&mdash;and it
also stopped the sale of their legitimate manufactures.&nbsp; The
offence merited such a punishment, and the practice had to be
stopped.</p>
<p>The order pointed out that the innocent had to suffer with the
guilty, &ldquo;If they connive at such scandalous proceedings
they themselves can no longer be considered free from blame, but
if they give the names of those who make or sell the toys and
drawings the market will again be opened.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Prisoners&rsquo; letters were intercepted, and a Corporal Hayes
of the garrison and a prisoner known as Black Jimmy were found to
be concerned in the traffic.&nbsp; Many articles were seized, and
Black Jimmy and others were sent to the hulks at
Chatham&mdash;such scum were among the men to whom Buonaparte
appealed on the eve of Waterloo to tell their comrades how they
had suffered in the British hulks.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>In
the course of the investigations undertaken with a view to the
suppression of this vicious manufacture, it was found that those
outside the prison who shared in the profits of the smuggling
trade in straw plait, became sufficiently demoralised to assist
the makers of these obscene articles in the disposal of their
goods, sharing with them the profits of the business.&nbsp; It
was probably in the sacks of straw, smuggled in by the
accomplices of the prisoners, that the weapons discovered in the
prison were introduced.</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject of the employment of the prisoners,
we must again remind our readers that the inmates performed the
fatigue duties of their prisons, and that there were other
distractions besides, which we have attempted to show in the
imaginary views of the life of the quadrangles given in the last
chapter.</p>
<p>As to the conduct of the captives, although it has been
necessary in the interests of truth to show the seamy side of the
prison life, it must in fairness be said that their general
conduct was good.</p>
<p>Deeds of violence did occur at times, as was only natural in a
community circumstanced and constituted as was this crowd of
prisoners of war; such deeds were, however, apparently
rare.&nbsp; Some instances with a fatal termination are culled
from entries in the register of deaths.&nbsp; &ldquo;A seaman,
aged twenty-three, killed from a blow in Prison by the following
Black Man&rdquo;&mdash;the next entry being one of a prisoner
born in Dominique&mdash;&ldquo;who hung himself in the Black
Hole&rdquo;; this man, &ldquo;born in Dominique,&rdquo; being
undoubtedly the Black Man of the previous entry.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
soldier, a French prisoner, killed by one Jean Fran&ccedil;ois
Pors in self-defence as the verdict at Coroner&rsquo;s
inquest.&rdquo;&nbsp; A sailor, captured at Trafalgar,
&ldquo;shot by a sergeant of the West Essex Militia, verdict by
Coroner&rsquo;s Inquest, Chance Medley.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to this
entry, is it not probable that this sergeant of the West Essex
Militia was the victim of the outrage reported in <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span><i>The
Stamford Mercury</i>, 12th February 1812, and that the chance
medley may have been a struggle over a bundle of straw
plait.&nbsp; In another entry death is occasioned by a stab from
one of the prisoners accidentally; this might well have been a
death in a duel, the witnesses of the duel, to exculpate the man
who gave the fatal wound, giving evidence which satisfied the
authorities that the stab was accidental.</p>
<p>Duels were not infrequent, the weapons usually extemporised
from knives which were fastened to sticks, or swords made out of
sharpened hoop-iron or other similar material; and although there
is no definite entry of a death as occurring in a duel, it is
more than probable that the above entry as to the soldier killed
by one Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Pors in self-defence is a euphemistic
way of expressing that he was killed in a duel, and that this was
the usual form of verdict on the victim of a fatal duel.&nbsp;
The entries in the registers and in the certificates cannot be
accepted as evidence disproving the statements of those who say
that such deaths occurred, as there is good reason to believe
that neither the registers nor the certificates were at certain
periods of the war kept with sufficient accuracy to render them
as valuable sources of information as they should have
been.&nbsp; And in the event of a violent death, necessitating an
inquest, at which the jury pronounces and the coroner records the
cause of death, it was not improbable that the prison
surgeon&rsquo;s certificate, confirmed by the signature of the
agent, would be missing from the records.&nbsp; Mention has
already been made of the imperfection and hopeless incompleteness
of the registers in the Record Office.</p>
<p>As might have been expected, there were many suicides some of
them while insane, and other violent deaths are recorded which do
not imply misconduct of any kind.&nbsp; Several prisoners were
shot in attempts to escape.&nbsp; Inquests were held in all such
cases, but the usual verdict <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>was &ldquo;Justifiable
homicide,&rdquo; or &ldquo;No criminality,&rdquo; and the case
went no further than the coroner&rsquo;s court.&nbsp; In some
instances the sentries were brought before a civil tribunal, this
probably depending on whether the death took place within the
precincts of the prison or outside.</p>
<p>Inquests were held in the following cases.&nbsp; One night in
1812, a prisoner carrying a bucket asked leave to pass a sentry
on guard at one of the inner gates (that of the Court in front of
the casern, in which the prisoners were confined after sunset),
saying that he wanted to get some water.&nbsp; He apparently
passed through, and threw the contents of the bucket, which was
actually <i>full</i> of water at the time, into the face of the
sentry, who dropped his firelock; the prisoner picked it up, and
unscrewed and ran off with the bayonet.&nbsp; The sentry, taking
up the firelock, fired and severely wounded the prisoner, who for
some reason or other was taken not to the prison hospital, but to
the Huntingdon Infirmary, where he died.&nbsp; The sentry was
tried for manslaughter and acquitted.</p>
<p>At the Hunts Lent Assizes 1812, Timothy Wood, aged
thirty-three, was tried for shooting a French prisoner of war at
Norman Cross, the Grand Jury finding no true bill.&nbsp; The
victim was probably the man whose certificate, one among a bundle
of fifty-six, registers as the cause of death, &ldquo;Wound,
Manslaughter, verdict by Coroner&rsquo;s inquest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The prisoner may actually have died outside the Depot, for the
date corresponds with the probable date when the mother of the
donor to the Peterborough Museum of the wine slides with paper
decoration saw the prisoner shot as he was scaling the boundary
wall.&nbsp; He probably dropped on the outside.</p>
<p>Among the causes of accidental death are several entries,
&ldquo;Fall from hammock&rdquo;; these cases, there is too much
reason to fear, were those of the poor debilitated, starving
prisoners&mdash;victims, according to the <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>French, of
British cruelty, according to the British, of their own
vice.&nbsp; Commissioner Serle was sent down to ascertain what
foundation there was for the French complaints, and he reports as
follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have been informed by some who are most
qualified to know, that the French prisons have never had so few
sick as at the present time.&nbsp; Some, indeed, who had sported
away their allowance in gambling, to prevent which the agents
have taken every precaution in their power, are in fact destitute
enough, and so they might have been, if their ration had been ten
times as great.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Commissioner Serle, 25th July
1800.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These instances will throw as much light on this side of the
prison life as if they were multiplied indefinitely.</p>
<p>Escapes and attempts to escape occurred, as might be expected,
during the whole eighteen years of the occupation of the
prison.&nbsp; From the records, chiefly paragraphs in local
papers, actual escapes or mere attempts to escape do not appear
to have been as numerous as in other prisons, which were nearer
the coast.&nbsp; The stockade fencing and the wooden buildings
(even the central fort, the Block House, was only wood) gave
little idea of strength, and the fence round one of the
quadrangles, when on one occasion put to the test, did not
withstand a united effort of the prisoners who effected a breach,
but the strong military force, the judicious disposition of the
guards, and the numerous sentries must have impressed the
prisoners with the hopelessness, when once within those lines, of
attempting to penetrate through to the fields beyond, where again
they had to encounter the inhabitants, who, for the sake of the
reward offered, would endeavour to recapture them.&nbsp; This
reward, paid to their captors, was actually paid by themselves,
for it will be remembered that among the <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>regulations
posted in the prison, was one to the effect, that any prisoner
who shall be taken attempting to escape, shall have his ration
reduced, until the amount saved by such reduction shall have made
good any expense incurred in his recapture.</p>
<p>In 1804, and again in 1807, after periods of increasing
insubordination among the prisoners, combined attempts to escape
were made.&nbsp; On the earlier date there were not more than
some 3,000 prisoners at the Depot, and on one day in October the
whole of these were in a state of tumult.&nbsp; The riot began in
the morning, and by noon the disorder had reached such a pitch
that the Brigade-Major thought it advisable to send to
Peterborough for assistance, specifying the need of cavalry to
scour the country in case a body of prisoners broke out.&nbsp; A
troop of the yeomanry, who had been having a field day, had not
been dismissed, and instantly galloped to Norman Cross, to be
followed later by the rest of the yeomanry and the volunteer
infantry.&nbsp; During the night a portion of the wooden
enclosure was broken down, and nine prisoners escaped; when
daylight broke, it was discovered that the prisoners had
excavated a tunnel thirty-four feet towards the North Road, under
the ditch, but not quite far enough to answer their
purpose.&nbsp; Four of those who escaped got clear off, five were
recaptured.</p>
<p>The engineering work for the construction of the tunnel must
have taken a long time; the soil is clay, but how such material,
carried out in pocketfuls and scattered about over the
airing-court, not much more than two acres in extent, can have
escaped the eye of the turnkeys, the doctors, and other
officials, will ever remain a mystery.&nbsp; If the word
&ldquo;<i>pr&eacute;</i>,&rdquo; used by Foulley in his
description of each court, may be literally translated as
&ldquo;meadow,&rdquo; implying that, the airing-courts, except
where they were paved for a space immediately within the boundary
fence, were covered <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>with grass, it is quite conceivable
that the scattering of the soil, skilfully carried out, would
scarcely be noticeable.</p>
<p>The other attempt in 1807 occurred on 25th September, when 500
of the prisoners, between ten and eleven at night, rushed
simultaneously against the interior paling of the prison and
levelled one angle of it to the ground.&nbsp; From forty to fifty
were severely wounded by the bayonet before they were driven
back; happily firearms were not used.&nbsp; It was after this
incident, showing the feebleness of the interior paling, that the
brick wall was erected in place of the outer wooden fence.</p>
<p>A letter written in 1798, by the agent, Mr. Perrot, to the
Transport Officer, Captain Woodriff, illustrates some of the
difficulties encountered in this large and understaffed prison by
the agent and others holding responsible posts.&nbsp; A rumour
having reached Mr. Perrot&rsquo;s ears that on a certain day an
attempt was to be made by seven prisoners to escape from the
south-eastern quadrangle, he had the usual count made that night,
and special counts twice on the following day, but the
irregularities in the response to the roll-call rendered it
futile for detecting any deficiency in the numbers.&nbsp; To
overcome the difficulty, Mr. Perrot at 5 a.m. took all his
clerks, a turnkey, and a file of soldiers into that quadrangle,
and had a separate muster of those confined within the separate
court of each of the four caserns; he thus discovered six
prisoners had escaped from the officers&rsquo; prison.&nbsp; How
they escaped was not discovered.&nbsp; In one fence a pale had
been removed, and probably bribery had overcome the other
obstacles.&nbsp; Any soldier or other person about the prison who
could be convicted of receiving a bribe or even treating with a
prisoner on the subject of an escape was severely punished,
soldiers having received 500 lashes for the offence.</p>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>How
necessary it was for the agent and the garrison to be at all
hours prepared for such attempts is shown by the fact that in
December 1808, when there were 6,000 prisoners at the Depot, a
search brought to light no fewer than 700 daggers of various
forms and workmanship.&nbsp; These had been introduced from
outside, as they were evidently not of prison manufacture.</p>
<p>On 26th October 1805, seven prisoners, taking advantage of the
dark and stormy night, escaped by cutting a large hole in their
wooden prison.&nbsp; After escaping through this opening, the
prisoners would still have to encounter the stockade fence of the
quadrangle, the cordon of sentries without it, the outer prison
wall (at that time also a wooden fence), the ditch, and another
cordon of sentries beyond them.&nbsp; It must almost of necessity
be assumed that these obstacles were overcome by the assistance
of others, individual sentries had probably been bribed to
connive at the escape, and the prisoners might have had a friend
outside to assist them, possibly a tender-hearted Huntingdonshire
damsel, whom they had met in the market and with whom they were
on terms, which enabled them to speak on more serious questions
than the sale and purchase of her wares.</p>
<p>About 8 o&rsquo;clock on the Sunday night a sergeant and
corporal of the Durham Division, out on leave from the Depot,
encountered the escaped prisoners near Stamford, recaptured two,
marched to the inn and placed them in security.&nbsp; The
prisoners were found to be a French naval captain and a
midshipman.&nbsp; These officers would normally have been on
parole; they were probably in prison for having broken their
parole, which was a crime punished severely.&nbsp; Two more were
captured near the neighbouring village of Ryhal, having been
concealed in Uffington thicket for twenty-four hours without
food.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>The
following narrative of an escape from Pembroke Prison illustrates
the application of the maxim, &ldquo;Cherchez la femme,&rdquo; to
these cases of escape:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Five hundred prisoners <a
name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156"
class="citation">[156]</a> were confined in a building on Golden
Hill, near Pembroke, and, as was the custom, they were allowed to
eke out the very meagre allowance voted for their subsistence by
the sale of toys, which they carved out of wood and bone.&nbsp;
Two Pembroke lasses were employed in bringing the odds and ends
requisite for this work, and in carrying away refuse from the
prison.&nbsp; These girls not having the law of nations or the
high policy of Europe before their eyes, dared to fall in love
with two of the Frenchmen, and formed a desperate resolve not
only to rescue their lovers, but the whole of the prisoners in
the same ward, 100 in number.&nbsp; It was impossible to smuggle
any tools into the prison, but a shin of horse beef seemed
harmless even in the eyes of a Pembroke Cerberus.&nbsp; With the
bone extracted from this delicacy the Frenchmen undermined the
walls, the faithful girls carrying off the soil in their refuse
buckets.&nbsp; When the subway was complete, the lasses watched
until some vessel should arrive.&nbsp; At length a sloop came in
loaded with a consignment of culm for Stackpole.&nbsp; That night
the liberated men made their way down to the water, seized the
sloop, and bound the crew hand and foot, but unfortunately the
vessel was high and dry, and it was found impossible to get her
off.&nbsp; Alongside was a small yacht belonging to Lord Cawdor
which they managed to launch.&nbsp; This would not take them all;
but the two women and twenty-five men got on board, taking with
them the compass, water casks, and provisions from the
sloop.&nbsp; In the morning there was a great hue and <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>cry.&nbsp;
Dr. Mansell, a leading man in Pembroke, posted handbills over the
whole county, offering 500 guineas for the recovery of these two
traitorous women, alive or dead.&nbsp; In a few days the stern of
the yacht and other wreckage being picked up, the patriotic party
were satisfied that the vengeance of Heaven had overtaken the
traitors.&nbsp; They were, however, mistaken, for the Frenchmen
captured a sloop laden with corn, and, abandoning the yacht,
compelled the crew to carry them to France.&nbsp; When they were
safe, it is pleasant to read that the commissary and engineer
married the girls.&nbsp; During the short peace, the engineer and
his wife returned to Pembroke and told their story; they then
went to Merthyr and obtained employment in the mines, but on the
renewal of hostilities went back to France, where it is to be
hoped they lived very happily ever afterwards.&rdquo; <a
name="citation157a"></a><a href="#footnote157a"
class="citation">[157a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happened in Pembroke probably happened in Hunts, and it
is a simple sum in proportion.</p>
<p>If 500 prisoners won the sympathy of two Welsh lasses, of how
many Huntingdon girls did 5,000 prisoners at Norman Cross win the
sympathy?</p>
<p>Seven prisoners got away in April 1801.&nbsp; Three privateer
officers were retaken at Boston, when they had already reached a
port; three others stole a boat at Freiston, and were taken, off
the Norfolk coast, by a Revenue cutter&mdash;one of them had a
chart of the Lincolnshire coast in his hat. <a
name="citation157b"></a><a href="#footnote157b"
class="citation">[157b]</a></p>
<p>Maps of England showing the best lines of escape were said to
be made in the prison and sold at twenty francs each.&nbsp;
Attention was directed in an earlier chapter to the few words in
Franco-English designating incorrectly in several instances, some
of the buildings in the Washingley plan (Plan A), which makes it
<a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>probable
that this plan had fallen into the hands of a prisoner, who
intended it to be an aid to his escape.&nbsp; Although the
sympathy of the public with the French prisoners was not general,
there were many outside Norman Cross who had been in the habit of
making money out of them in the straw-plait traffic; these would
be willing for a consideration to help them when once they were
beyond the prison walls and the lines of sentries.</p>
<p>An extraordinary recapture occurred in May 1804.&nbsp; Two of
the French prisoners who had escaped, on clearing the precincts
of the barracks pursued different routes.&nbsp; One of them was
fortunate enough to get clear away; the other, quitting the
public road, had pursued his course a few miles when he met with
a most singular obstruction.&nbsp; In crossing a stile he was
beset by a shepherd&rsquo;s dog, &ldquo;of the ordinary and true
English breed,&rdquo; which absolutely opposed the poor
fellow&rsquo;s progress.&nbsp; Neither enticement nor resistance
availed, the dog repeatedly fastened on the legs and heels of the
fugitive and held him at bay, until the continued noise of the
quarrel brought some persons to the spot and ultimately led to
the detection of the prisoner, and his reincarceration at the
Depot. <a name="citation158"></a><a href="#footnote158"
class="citation">[158]</a>&nbsp; Whether the dog got any share of
the 10<i>s.</i> usually given for the recapture of a prisoner is
not recorded.</p>
<p>In the register of the Dutch prisoners confined at Norman
Cross between 1797 and 1800, is the record of Jan Cramer, one of
the sailors who were taken in the great victory of Admiral Duncan
off Camperdown, 11th October 1797; he was received at Norman
Cross 23rd December of that year, and the four words in the
register which describe the method of his leaving the prison,
&ldquo;<i>escaped in a chest</i>,&rdquo; are sufficient to enable
an imaginative writer to compose an exciting narrative
&ldquo;founded on fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>Mention has already been made of the escape of one
prisoner in a &ldquo;manure cart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the dread of the hulks before them, on 18th August 1809
twelve out of a party of thirty prisoners marching from Norman
Cross to Chatham, having nearly reached the place of their
punishment, were lodged for the night in a stable at Bow and
managed to escape.&nbsp; A party of the Westminster Militia
formed the escort.</p>
<p>The mere dread of the long imprisonment before them and
probably the greater facility for the adventure led to several
escapes while the prisoners were on the march from the coast to
Norman Cross; these were sometimes successful.&nbsp; Thus in
September 1797 a batch of 142 left Yarmouth for Yaxley; but only
141 entered Norman Cross, one having slipped away at Norwich.</p>
<p>A cruel fate awaited some of the unfortunates who made such
attempts.&nbsp; Two deaths occurred in Peterborough.&nbsp; On the
4th February 1808 a party of prisoners were lodged for the night
in a stable in the yard of the Angel Inn, and one of them
attempting to escape was shot by the sentinel, dying in twenty
minutes; the verdict at the inquest was, &ldquo;justifiable
homicide.&rdquo;&nbsp; On another occasion, one of a company of
the poor fellows crossing the bridge, leapt over the low rail at
the side, into the river, and was shot by the escort.&nbsp; On
the 6th October 1799 a prisoner, Jean de Narde, son of a notary
public of St. Malo, escaped and was recaptured on his way to the
sea; he was confined for the night in the Bell Tower of East
Dereham Church, from which he again attempted to escape, but was
shot as he clambered down by a soldier on guard.&nbsp; He was
buried in the churchyard, and fifty-eight years after a tombstone
was erected by the vicar and two friends &ldquo;as a memorial to
Jean de Narde and as a tribute of respect to that brave and
generous nation, once our foes, but <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>now our allies and
brethren.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inscription on the stone is:</p>

<p>Terribly handicapped as were the captives in their efforts to
escape, the game was not entirely in the hands of the man with
the firelock, if a tradition of the seven years&rsquo; war,
1756&ndash;63, is to be credited.&nbsp; An old family mansion at
Sissinghurst was in that war used as a place of confinement for
the French.&nbsp; In the Register of Burials is an entry in 1761,
&ldquo;William Bassuck, killed by a French Prisoner at

a prisoner who, like poor Jean de Narde forty years later at East
Dereham, mounted the tower, and dropping a pail of water on the
head of the sentry below, killed him on the spot. <a

<p>Newspaper paragraphs are not always in strict accordance with
fact, but these few examples of escapes which took place may be
accepted as types of the many.&nbsp; A narrative told with much
detail and a vraisemblance, which makes it excellent reading,
supposed to be written by the prisoner himself, but actually
written by Mr. Bell, a schoolmaster of Oundle, who was said to
have been familiar with the Depot, where he was employed in his
early life, appeared first in <i>Chambers&rsquo; Miscellany</i>.

of the article in <i>Chambers&rsquo; Miscellany</i> the following
note is appended:</p>

<p>The following story would have appeared absolutely incredible
had not Basil Thomson <a name="citation161"></a><a

escape of eight prisoners from Dartmoor by the same stratagem as
that attributed to a Norman Cross prisoner in a note in <i>The
Soldiers&rsquo; Companion or Martial Recorder</i>, l. 190.&nbsp;
1824:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">French Ingenuity</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A French Prisoner in Norman Cross Barracks had recourse
to the following stratagem to obtain his liberty: He made himself
a complete uniform of the Hertfordshire Militia, and a wooden
gun, stained, surmounted by a tin bayonet.&nbsp; Thus equipped,
he mixed with the guard (consisting of men from the Hertford
Regiment), and when they were ordered to march out, having been
relieved, Monsieur fell in and marched out too.&nbsp; Thus far he
was fortunate, but when arrived at the guard room, lo! what befel
him.&nbsp; His new comrades ranged their muskets on the rack, and
he endeavoured to follow their example; but as his wooden piece
was unfortunately a few inches too long, he was unabled to place
it properly.&nbsp; This was observed, and the unfortunate captive
obliged to forego the hopes of that liberty for which he had so
anxiously and so ingeniously laboured.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Before concluding this chapter, which has dealt with
the conduct of the prisoners, two other facts may be
mentioned.&nbsp; Shortly after the opening of the prison a
disturbance among a batch of prisoners from Chatham led to the
construction of the Black Hole and the requisition for two dozen
handcuffs.&nbsp; In October of the following year the Depot
narrowly escaped destruction by fire&mdash;whether accidental or
the work of an incendiary is not known; two thatched huts
adjoining the wooden buildings were in flames, but the exertions
of the Military were sufficient to prevent the spread of the
conflagration which would so easily, in unfavourable conditions
as to wind, etc., have consumed the whole building.&nbsp; It was
after this fire that an application was made for a
fire-engine.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">THE SICK AND THE HOSPITAL</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> general health of the prisoners
was good, but occasional epidemics led to a temporary very heavy
mortality, the miserable men who had sold their rations and
clothes to provide money for gambling dying off so rapidly, and
in such numbers, that no room could be found for them in the
well-equipped hospital.</p>
<p>In November 1800 there broke out an appalling epidemic, which
raged for five months and then began to abate; the daily average
of deaths of the prisoners at this Depot during the four worst
months of the pestilence was over eight.&nbsp; In this epidemic,
1800&ndash;01, during the six months with the heaviest mortality,
1,020 died.&nbsp; In the corresponding six months, 1801&ndash;02,
when the mortality had been almost restored to what was normal,
the deaths were only twenty.&nbsp; The staff could evidently not
keep abreast of their work, the hospital was full to overflowing,
and many of &ldquo;Les Mis&eacute;rables&rdquo; died in their
hammocks in the caserns.</p>
<p>Enteric or typhoid fever was not known as a distinct disease
until the last century was well advanced, and the epidemic was
probably typhoid to which &ldquo;Les Mis&eacute;rables&rdquo;
succumbed at the first shock, the cause of their death being
registered as debility.&nbsp; It is a safe <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>conjecture
that some of the wells had been infected.&nbsp; That the
authorities did not take this tragic visitation, without efforts
to cope with it, is evidenced by short notes among the
certificates of death; delicate prisoners and invalids were
apparently sent to France, and others to special hulks.&nbsp; How
inadequate was the meagre staff to meet an exceptional case such
as this is proved by the fact that twenty-nine prisoners in the
first four months of the year were taken out of their hammocks,
dead or speechless, and could not be identified for entry in the
register, of which a copy was regularly supplied to the French
Government; they were buried unknown.&nbsp; It was not until the
epidemic had abated, and a special investigation had been held,
that Captain Woodriff was able to establish the identity of these
twenty-nine persons; a special list of them is inserted in the
register, and another list of five who were found to be alive in
prison, and who had been returned as dead owing to mistaken
identity.</p>
<p>In 1804 the total mortality among all the prisoners for the
whole year was only eighteen.&nbsp; On 1st January 1801 nine died
in one day, and to this day&rsquo;s entry there is added the
explanatory note, &ldquo;These men being in the habit of selling
their bedding and rations, died of debility in this prison, there
not being room in the hospital to receive them.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
is a terrible indictment against someone, even though the victims
were the lost bestial creatures whose fuller history was written
at Dartmoor&mdash;prisoners ostracised by their comrades,
banished to some one compartment of the prison, apparently No.
13, and left to die there by their compatriots who occupied the
same quadrangle.&nbsp; This single day&rsquo;s record justifies
what was said in the introductory remarks as to the lot of
prisoners of war, but&mdash;<i>Laus Deo</i>&mdash;the advance in
humanity, and the consequent change of opinion as to the suitable
treatment of prisoners of all kinds, and the progress of
hygienic, medical, and other <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>sciences, make it inconceivable
that, under any circumstances, similar tragedies could now occur
in any European country.</p>
<p>No exact percentage of mortality for the seventeen years
during which the prison was occupied can be given, the records
being incomplete, and the population of the prison changing
continually from week to week and month to month, owing to the
accession of fresh prisoners and the departure of others, due to
death, transference to other prisons, or exchange.&nbsp; The
reports to the Commissioners for the sick and hurt, except in the
incomplete bundles of certificates, do not appear until the
second period of the war, although the sick and hurt passed at
once under the care of this Board as soon as they ceased to be
prisoners in health.&nbsp; The actual number of deaths certified
is 1,770, of which 1,000 occurred during the epidemic
1800&ndash;01, the remainder being distributed over the remaining
fifteen years in which the prison was occupied.</p>
<p>It is possible that the original register kept at this prison
before the Peace of Amiens, 1797&ndash;1802, might have been sent
to France and may yet be found, but at present separate bundles
of single certificates are for many years the only records from
which these figures are obtained.&nbsp; The total number of
deaths registered of French prisoners who died at Norman Cross in
the second period of the war, 1803&ndash;14, was 559.&nbsp; The
highest number recorded in any one year, was 98 in 1806.&nbsp;
The lowest, in any complete year, was 18 in 1804.&nbsp; One of
those whose death is recorded in that year is a boy of ten, a
native of Bordeaux, captured on a privateer; he died of
consumption.&nbsp; The diseases, phthisis, h&aelig;moptysis,
scrophula, which appear again and again under the heading
&ldquo;Cause of Death,&rdquo; were all, as well as many of those
entered as catarrh and debility, tubercular diseases, due to the
condition so favourable to contagion in which the prisoners
slept, <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>herded together in closely packed chambers, ventilated
very imperfectly.&nbsp; In all probability, in cold weather,
every aperture by which fresh air could enter was closed by the
inmates themselves, who would not be imbued with
twentieth-century ideas as to the need of fresh air.</p>
<p>Putting on one side the tubercular cases and the rare
epidemics, there was comparatively little sickness among the
prisoners.&nbsp; When an epidemic occurred, &ldquo;Les
Mis&eacute;rables,&rdquo; whose powers of resistance had been
lowered by the semi-starvation which they had brought upon
themselves, naturally sickened and in too many instances
succumbed.</p>
<p>Owing, doubtless, to three causes&mdash;the absence of
facility for getting drink, the spare but sufficient diet, and
the regulation which appointed that the prisoners should, unless
in bad weather, live through the day in the open air [&ldquo;They
have free access to the several apartments from the opening of
the prisons in the morning, until they are shut up on the
approach of night, with the exception only of the times when they
are fumigating, or cleansing for the preservation of
health&rdquo; (Commissioner Serle, Appendix D, No. 31)]&mdash;the
rate of mortality among the prisoners in confinement was lower
than that among those on parole, and, as far as it has been
possible to come approximately to the percentage rate of
mortality, than that also of the British soldiers who constituted
the garrison.&nbsp; The absurd statements of Mr. Charretie, the
falsehood of which he had to acknowledge, and Colonel
Lebertre&rsquo;s lie, that at Norman Cross 4,000 out of 10,000
died, <a name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166"
class="citation">[166]</a> gave rise to an impression which, once
made, has not been easily effaced.&nbsp; Of those who read these
statements in France, few read the statement of facts which prove
them false.&nbsp; Taking the total number of those who had been
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>imprisoned at the Depot, up to 1813, as at least
30,000, and the deaths at 1,800 (these figures being approximate
only), the actual proportions of deaths would be 6 per cent.,
instead of 40 per cent. as affirmed by Lebertre.&nbsp; A return
showing the total number of prisoners and the number of sick in
every Depot or other place of confinement for prisoners of war,
called for on 10th April 1810, and a similar return presented in
the following year, show the extraordinary healthiness of the
prison at Norman Cross, and of all the other prisons in Great
Britain on each of those days. <a name="citation167a"></a><a
href="#footnote167a" class="citation">[167a]</a></p>
<p>In August 1812, in answer to the calumnies in the columns of
the <i>Moniteur</i>, a return was obtained as to the health of
the prisoners in the prison ships in Herne Bay and at the
Dartmoor Depot.&nbsp; In the former there were 6,100 in health,
61 sick; in the latter, 7,500 well, 70 sick.&nbsp; The proportion
of sick was less than in other prisons not of war. <a
name="citation167b"></a><a href="#footnote167b"
class="citation">[167b]</a></p>
<p>This was at a time when the influx of prisoners from the
Peninsula and elsewhere had caused the prisons to be so crowded,
that it had become necessary to again spend large amounts in
building new prisons.&nbsp; At the time of the return in 1810,
&pound;130,000 was being expended on a new prison at Perth;
Norman Cross contained 272 more than the highest number for whom
it was calculated to provide accommodation, and there must have
been 2,000 men in each quadrangle, except that for the sick.</p>
<p>In these two years the number of deaths at Norman Cross was
respectively only forty-one and thirty-three.&nbsp; When a
prisoner fell ill, and was admitted into the prison hospital, he
was treated as well as, or better than, the soldiers in the
military hospital outside the prison walls.</p>
<p>We have already dealt with the reckless statement <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>of the
French while dealing with Mr. Pillet.&nbsp; They are wicked
calumnies, which, even on a casual examination, carry with them
their own contradiction.&nbsp; The British Government expended an
enormous sum on the prisoners, and in 1817 made a claim on the
French for the maintenance of French prisoners in England. <a
name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168"
class="citation">[168]</a>&nbsp; The correctness of that claim
was never questioned; whether it was settled is another
matter.&nbsp; According to Alison, the British Government
generously forgave the debt.</p>
<p>The prisoners in each quadrangle were visited daily by the
surgeons, and any prisoner complaining of illness, and found by
the doctors to have good ground for his complaint, was removed at
once to the hospital, where he was, according to the sworn
evidence of the French surgeons themselves, carefully and
liberally treated.&nbsp; From the pay-sheets accompanying the
hospital accounts, the earliest of which at the Record Office is
for the year 1806, the staff of the hospital appears to have been
at that time, the surgeon (Mr. Geo. Walker), two
assistant-surgeons (M. Pierre Larfeuil and Mr. Anthony Howard), a
dispenser, an assistant-dispenser (prisoner), dispensary porter
(do) and messenger (do), two hospital mates and clerk, a steward
of victualling, a steward of bedding, with two assistants
(prisoners), two turnkeys, matron, and seamstress (the two last
named and the wives of the married turnkeys being, up to the
advent of the surgeon&rsquo;s bride in 1808, the only women
within the prison walls), a messenger, and the following
thirteen, who were all prisoners, two interpreters, one tailor,
one washerman, one carpenter (who made bed-cradles and other
appliances for the ward and did odd jobs), an assistant
lamplighter (a more important post than it sounds, as it would be
very convenient for any prisoner or prisoners wanting to <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>escape to
find a careless lamplighter, who would forget to light, or supply
with sufficient oil, one or two of the numerous lamps which
lighted the prison and its environs), two stocking-menders, two
labourers, one barber for the infirm and itchy, and two
nurses&mdash;in all, thirteen British and twenty French
prisoners, the staff of nurses being, of course, increased if
necessary. <a name="citation169"></a><a href="#footnote169"
class="citation">[169]</a>&nbsp; The hospital was evidently
conducted on a liberal scale.&nbsp; The dietary was ample; it was
as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Established Diet</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">1<i>st</i>.&nbsp; <i>Full
Diet</i></p>
<p>Tea, or water-gruel with salt, for breakfast; the same for
supper.&nbsp; Meat 12 oz., with potatoes or greens, and 1 pint of
broth, for dinner.&nbsp; Bread 14 oz., sugar 2 oz., beer 2 pints
(of beer at 16<i>s.</i> the 38 gallons), and if any other drink
is wanted, water, or toast and water.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">2<i>nd</i>.&nbsp; <i>Reduced
Diet</i></p>
<p>Tea, or water-gruel with salt, for breakfast; the same for
supper.&nbsp; Meat 6 oz., with potatoes or greens, and 1 pint of

quality of bread and beer as on full diet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">3<i>rd</i>.&nbsp; <i>Low
Diet</i></p>
<p>Water-gruel or tea for breakfast.&nbsp; Water-gruel or
barley-water for dinner.&nbsp; The same or rice-water for
supper.&nbsp; Bread 7 oz.&nbsp; Patients on low diet are supposed
to require no stated meal, drinks only being allowable, or even
desirable; a small quantity of beer may be given when anxiously
wished for and permitted by their surgeon.&nbsp; The bread is
supposed to be chiefly for toast and water, or, should the
patient incline, a bit of toasted bread without butter, with a
little of his gruel or tea.&nbsp; Sugar 2 oz.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>4<i>th</i>.&nbsp; <i>Milk
Diet</i></p>
<p>Milk, 1 pint, for breakfast.&nbsp; Rice-milk, 1 pint and a
half (sweetened with sugar when desired), for dinner.&nbsp; Milk,
1 pint, for supper.&nbsp; Bread 14 oz.&nbsp; Drink&mdash;water,
barley-water, or rice-water.&nbsp; Sugar 2 oz.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">5<i>th</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mixed

<p>Milk, 1 pint, for breakfast.&nbsp; Meat 4 oz., with potatoes
or greens, and 1 pint of broth, for dinner.&nbsp; Milk, 1 pint,
for supper.&nbsp; Bread 14 oz.&nbsp; Drinks as on milk
diet.&nbsp; Sugar 2 oz.&nbsp; Beer 1 pint.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Notes</i></p>
<p>The meat mentioned in the different diets to be beef and
mutton alternately.&nbsp; Should any patient particularly require
a mutton-chop or beefsteak, instead of either the beef or mutton
boiled and made into broth, the surgeon may direct it
accordingly.</p>
<p>The matron is allowed to purchase ripe fruit, or any other
article not comprehended in the several diets, by permission and
direction of the surgeon.</p>
<p>Sago, when particularly ordered by the surgeon, will be
furnished in the quantity equal to the value of one day&rsquo;s
ordinary diet, but then for that day the matron is to supply
nothing else, save toast and water, water-gruel, or barley-water,
and any bread which may be ordered by the surgeon.</p>
<p>No beer is to be issued to any patient in the hospital until
after dinner, unless particularly ordered by his surgeon, and no
patient is allowed to give his allowance of beer to another, for
when he does not choose the whole, or any part of it, it is to
remain with the matron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, when we look to the sanitary condition of the
hospital, its staff, its furnishing, the diet, the arrangements
for the admission, the retention, and the treatment <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>of the
patients, we find in the records sufficient evidence that the
provision for the care of the sick prisoners was at Norman Cross
equal to, if not superior to, that offered by any civil
institution of that date.</p>
<p>To pass from the discomforts of the prison to the luxurious
life of the hospital was a temptation which favoured malingering,
especially in the case of one of &ldquo;Les
Mis&eacute;rables,&rdquo; who, having nothing left wherewith to
gamble, needed a bed and food.&nbsp; The agent had in 1801, to
issue a special order as to the precautions necessary to prevent
prisoners shamming illness in order to obtain admission into the
hospital.&nbsp; This was the year of the epidemic, when the
hospital had been in the earlier months overcrowded, and we can
only trust that no mistake was ever made, and that no prisoner
sickening for the fatal disease was dealt with as a malingerer
and denied admission into the wards.</p>
<p>As stated in an early chapter, the prisoners passed out of the
agent&rsquo;s charge when they fell sick, and the order of
Captain Woodriff may have been the result of friction between
himself and the surgeons.</p>
<p>The excellent arrangements made by the Government department
for the care of the sick and wounded gave the sick prisoners the
best chance of recovery.&nbsp; It was, nevertheless, the cruel
fate of nearly 1,800 of those incarcerated at Norman Cross
between 1797 and 1814 to end a captivity which had endured for a
period varying from a few days to eleven years, without the
solace of a glimpse of their native land, away from relatives,
friends, and home, by death in the prison hospital, whence their
bodies were borne to be laid in the prisoners&rsquo; cemetery,
where they still lie, unknown and unhonoured. <a

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a short period after the
occupation of the Depot, the prisoners who died were buried
outside the prison wall, in the north-east corner of the
site.&nbsp; The discovery of human skeletons by workmen engaged
in excavating gravel in this locality gave rise to tales of
violent deaths in duels and of surreptitious burials, tales which
have to be dismissed as idle since our researches have brought to
light the fact that the spot was for a brief period&mdash;the
exact length of which cannot be determined&mdash;the burial-place
of the prisoners.&nbsp; It is certain that very few burials took
place in this corner.&nbsp; Early in the history of the prison,
as mentioned in a previous chapter, the Government bought a
portion of a field on the opposite&mdash;the western&mdash;side
of the North Road for use as the prisoners&rsquo; cemetery, and
in this field rest the remains of at least 1,770 of the captives
taken by us in that long war.</p>
<p>There is nothing now to distinguish the prisoners&rsquo;
cemetery from the surrounding fields; it is only by careful
observation that the irregularities of the surface can be
recognised as the mounds which mark the graves, these in the
course of a hundred years having become very ill defined.</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>The
occasional disturbance of the bones of the dead in agricultural
operations, or by irreverent explorations of the graves by the
village lads, alone keep alive in the minds of the rustic
population the knowledge of this burial-place.&nbsp; The
burial-places attached to other depots for prisoners of war have
one after the other been distinguished by a monument erected to
the memory of those who lie in them.&nbsp; Too long has the
respect due to the memory of the brave men who fought and
suffered for their country, and died at Norman Cross, been
forgotten.&nbsp; Too long, alike by the nation whose foes these
prisoners were and by the nation whose sons they were, has this
God&rsquo;s Acre, doubly sacred, because in it lie only patriots
who died for their native land, been neglected and left without a
mark to show that it is a sacred spot.&nbsp; Happily the
animosity of a hundred years ago has been replaced by
<i>L&rsquo;Entente Cordiale</i>, and a movement originated by Mr.
H. B. Sands, the late Secretary of the Association which has
adopted that title, is even now in progress, the object of the
movement being to acquire a portion of the ground, to fence it,
and to erect upon it, close to the North Road, a monument with a
suitable inscription to the memory of the foreign soldiers and
sailors who, after years of captivity, died in the prison, and
were buried in this neglected spot.</p>
<p>The information as to any provision for the spiritual welfare
of the prisoners is very meagre.&nbsp; Marriages and births,
calling for the sanctification of a church, there were none, but
1,770 deaths and burials there certainly were, as the
certificates show.</p>
<p>Neither in the register nor on the certificate of those
deaths, whether the prisoners were Roman Catholic or Protestant,
does the name of priest or parson appear.</p>
<p>This applies only to the prisoners who died in confinement,
not to the soldiers who guarded them.&nbsp; The Depot was in the
parish of Yaxley, and in the churchyard <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>of St.
Peter&rsquo;s, the parish church, the majority of the British
soldiers who died while quartered at the barracks were buried,
and their names are entered in the parish register and signed by
the officiating minister.</p>
<p>The first entry connected with the Depot in the Yaxley
Register is that of &ldquo;John Smart, suffocated at the
Barracks, February 12th, 1797.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was probably a
workman employed during the erection of the buildings, which were
not occupied until two months later; after this date, and up to
1814, occur entries of soldiers&rsquo; burials at the rate of
from twenty to thirty per annum.</p>
<p>The last funeral from the barracks was that of Captain
Pressland on 21st March 1814.&nbsp; After fifteen years the
soldiers&rsquo; graves were crowding the churchyard to such an
extent, that in 1813 a plot of land adjoining the
barrack-master&rsquo;s house was purchased by the Government for
a special burial-place for the barracks, and the ground was
consecrated by the Bishop of Lincoln on 29th October in that
year.&nbsp; The first soldier was buried in it on 4th November
1813, just seven months before the clearing of the barracks and
the prisons was accomplished.&nbsp; This plot has been absorbed
into the property on which stands the barrack-master&rsquo;s
house, now owned by J. A. Herbert, J.P.&nbsp; When and how the
absorption took place is not known; it is now an orchard, and the
few gravestones there were in it have disappeared.&nbsp; From the
Register of Folksworth, about a mile from the barracks, it would
appear that this village was a favourite place for the wives of
the married soldiers quartered at Norman Cross to reside; several
baptisms of the soldiers&rsquo; children, and one or two of the
adult soldiers themselves, are there registered.</p>
<p>The prisoners&rsquo; cemetery and the barracks were in the
mission of the Roman Catholic priest who lived at King&rsquo;s
Cliffe, but no register of deaths kept by him is known to exist,
nor is there any record by a minister of religion of any burial
service in this cemetery.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>It
must, I fear, be accepted that the men who were in captivity at
Norman Cross during the seventeen years the prison was occupied
received very little spiritual help, and in times of pressure
many of those whose bones lie in the prisoners&rsquo;
burial-place were, too probably, interred without religious rites
of any kind, and scarcely ever with a single mourner at the grave
side.</p>
<p>From the possibilities, nay probabilities of the burials
during the epidemic of 1800&ndash;01, let us turn with a shudder
and a sigh of regret for whatever blame attaches to our country
for that tragic year in the history of Norman Cross.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sands says that, in examining the register in the Record
Office, she and her late husband found that a large number of
those buried came from Protestant provinces of France.</p>
<p>The Depot being in Yaxley parish, it is probable that during
its occupation the vicar would be asked to bury the Protestants
and possibly to minister to the sick and others in the
prison.&nbsp; But that no entry of any such burial is found in
the parish registers, nor any note by an incumbent of duty
performed either in the prison or cemetery, points to the fact
that the prison was considered extra-parochial.&nbsp; The present
vicar, the Rev. E. H. Brown, who is keenly interested in the
subject of this narrative, has ascertained from a relative of the
Rev. T. Hinde that, to her certain knowledge, that clergyman, a
former curate of Yaxley, was &ldquo;Protestant chaplain to Norman
Cross Barracks.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Brown adds that Mr. Hinde was
apparently curate from September 1813 to January 1816; this would
cover the last eight months only of the prison occupation.</p>
<p>This statement, from a member of Mr. Hinde&rsquo;s family,
leaves room to <i>hope</i> that the Vicar of Yaxley or his curate
actually officiated as Protestant minister for those prisoners
who were his co-religionists during their enforced sojourn within
the boundaries of his cure.</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>But
it must be borne in mind that those days were not as ours, and
that there was little probability that Britain&rsquo;s prisoners
would be better treated than her soldiers and sailors.&nbsp; A
writer in <i>Notes and Queries</i> quotes, respecting the
treatment of the latter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gleig&mdash;&lsquo;The Subaltern&rsquo; of
1813&ndash;14, who subsequently took holy orders and wrote a
<i>Life of Wellington</i>&mdash;assures us that a hundred years
ago Tommy Atkins was &lsquo;spaded under&rsquo; without benefit
of clergy, and it is highly improbable that any existing memorial
marks, nay, that any memorial ever marked, the grave of even one
of the thousands of British privates who lie among the Spanish
hills and valleys.&nbsp; All that the tourist can hope to find in
these distant and lonely spots is the occasional tomb of a
British officer, or (quite exceptionally) of a favourite
&lsquo;non-com.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation177"></a><a
href="#footnote177" class="citation">[177]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That priests did frequent the prison in the earlier years of
the war, 1797&ndash;1802, before the Peace of Amiens, we know
from the correspondence of the Transport Commissioners with the
agents.&nbsp; The prisoners themselves petitioned to have priests
sent to them, and at length two priests were permitted to reside
in the prison.&nbsp; That these gentlemen did not strictly
confine themselves to the spiritual duties of their office we
have reason to believe from an instruction given to Captain
Pressland, the agent appointed when the prison was reopened in
1803.&nbsp; He was told that, &ldquo;profiting by experience
gained during the previous war,&rdquo; the Board had decided that
&ldquo;no priests were to be admitted, except in extreme cases,
and then under carefully arranged restrictions, as they had
abused the privileges allowed them,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;a
turnkey or clerk was to be present during the whole time they
were in the hospital.&rdquo;&nbsp; This memorandum evidently
implies that at this time there was no regular provision for the
spiritual needs of the general body of <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>prisoners,
no chaplain appointed by the authorities, and that no regular
visitation except to the sick and dying was to be permitted.</p>
<p>The Government was not without evidence that many of these
priests had supplemented the spiritual aid by acting as
go-betweens and secretly conveying correspondence to and from the
prisoners.&nbsp; Any collusion between the prisoners and possible
foreign agents outside was provided against by the regulation
that all letters should pass through the agent&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>The continual recurrence throughout the war of plots for a
general rising, originating with the French Government; the
frequent attempts either of single prisoners or a combined body
of them to escape, were probably, at the period with which we are
dealing, felt to be sufficient reason for an order which in the
present day would hardly be tolerated by the British
public.&nbsp; A year later, in 1804, the commissioners, while
affirming that they had no power to prevent French priests living
in Stilton, were most decided in declining to allow them to live
in the Depot, saying that at such a critical time they could not
possibly grant such a privilege to foreigners &ldquo;of that
equivocal description&rdquo;!</p>
<p>The Transport Board must have seen reason to relax the orders,
for three years after this direction was given we find the Bishop
of Moulins not resident in the Depot, but living at Stilton a
mile from it, on an allowance received from the British
Government, and earning a high character for his work among the
prisoners.&nbsp; He was also officiating outside the prison, for
in the register kept by the neighbouring priest, the Rev. W.
Hayes of King&rsquo;s Cliffe, in whose mission Stilton was, are,
among others, the following three entries of baptisms to which
allusion has already been made in Chap. IV, p. 59:</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; &ldquo;1807.&mdash;John Stephen Felix Delapoux, son
of John Andrew Delapoux and of Sarah Mason (his lawful wife), of
Norman Cross, Yaxley, Huntingdonshire, was <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>born July
22 and baptised August 2nd, 1807, following, by Charles Lewis de
Salmon du Chattelier, formerly Vicar General of the Diocese of
Mans, and Canon of the Cathedral Church.&nbsp; Sponsor, the Rt.
Rev. Stephen John Baptist Lewis de Galois de la Tour, residing at
Stilton in the said county, which I, the undersigned, hereby
certify from the original.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;W. <span
class="smcap">Hayes</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; &ldquo;1808.&mdash;William, son of Hugh and
Margaret Drummond, was baptised by the Bishop of Moulins at
Stilton, Hunts., May 30th, 1808.&nbsp; Sponsors, Edward Courier
and Margaret Anderson, attested by Mr. Wm. Hayes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; &ldquo;1814.&mdash;Louis Stanilas Henry Paschal,
son of John Andrew Delapoux and of Sarah Mason (his lawful wife)
of Yaxley, Huntingdonshire, on May 3rd, was baptised May 14th,
1814, by the Rt. Rev. Stephen John Baptist Lewis de Galois de la
Tour, residing at Stilton.&nbsp; Sponsor, Mr. Paschal Levisse of
Oundle, Northamptonshire, which I, the undersigned, hereby
certify from the original act.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;W. <span
class="smcap">Hayes</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first entry, 1807, the officiating priest is &ldquo;the
late Vicar General of the Diocese of Mans, and Canon of the
Cathedral Church,&rdquo; who was possibly attending to the
prisoners until the Sponsor, the Rt. Rev. Stephen John Baptist
Lewis de Galois de la Tours (the Bishop-designate of Moulins),
took up the work.&nbsp; John Andrew Delapoux, the father of the
child, was a clerk at Norman Cross&mdash;many of the officials
had French names, and were probably naturalised British subjects,
or children of naturalised Frenchmen and familiar with the French
language.&nbsp; He had been married to Miss Mason, in Stilton
Parish Church, on 2nd September 1802, and until the research
undertaken for the purposes of this work revealed his identity,
these were supposed to be entries of the baptisms of children of
a French prisoner who had married an English wife.&nbsp; In the
second, 1808, <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>the Bishop of Moulins is entered as the officiating
priest.&nbsp; In the 3rd the priest performing the ceremony is
the Rt. Rev. Stephen John Baptist Lewis de Galois de la
Tour.&nbsp; The priest in whose mission the Baptism took place
and who made the entry, gave the Christian and family names of
the Bishop-designate of Moulins, but not the episcopal title, as
in the second entry.&nbsp; The prefix Right Reverend marks the
ecclesiastical rank claimed by the Bishop; but a letter from Lord
Mulgrave <a name="citation180a"></a><a href="#footnote180a"
class="citation">[180a]</a> states that he was only
Bishop-designate.&nbsp; He had never been consecrated, and he
would therefore not be always recognised by his brethren as
&Eacute;v&ecirc;que de Moulins.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that it is the duty of the humblest
historian to push aside the glamour that tradition and the
writers of romance weave around a man and to show him as he is,
and the traditional story of the Bishop of Moulins is not the
only illusion which has been dispelled in the course of our
investigations.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Moulins has been, by traditions authoritatively
reproduced in print, gradually elevated to the position of a
saint who voluntarily relinquished his high office in France, and
sacrificed its emoluments <i>in order that he might minister to
his fellow countrymen in captivity</i>.&nbsp; In his little
romance, <a name="citation180b"></a><a href="#footnote180b"
class="citation">[180b]</a> the late Rev. Arthur Brown says, p.
44:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the Chaplain was none other than the
Bishop of Moulins.&nbsp; <i>He had voluntarily come to England
out of pure compassion for his imprisoned countrymen</i>, <i>and
with true missionary zeal was giving himself up to their
spiritual welfare</i>.&nbsp; He was a venerable-looking man, much
respected by the prisoners generally.&nbsp; <i>It was a noble act
of self-sacrifice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>In a
romance it is quite legitimate to adopt a name for an imaginary
character, and to endow the fictitious individual with virtues
which the real owner of the name did not possess, but Mr. Brown
emphatically declares this passage to be <i>history</i>, and not
fiction, by a footnote, of which the first sentence is,
&ldquo;This is fact, not fiction.&rdquo;&nbsp; The note
continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It would be interesting to know the history
of this good man after the prisoners were discharged in
1814.&nbsp; One thing is certain, that he must ever have enjoyed
a feast of memory to his dying day, in having been a shepherd and
bishop of souls to these poor prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The late Rev. G. N. Godwin, in the series of papers on
&ldquo;Norman Cross and its French Prisoners,&rdquo; published in
the <i>Peterborough Advertiser</i> in February and March 1906,
says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Depot had a noble Chaplain in the
Bishop of Moulins, who voluntarily came over from France, and
lived at his own charge and upon remittances from France, in the
High Street, Stilton, near the Bell Inn.&nbsp; (The house which
is now shored up. <a name="citation181"></a><a
href="#footnote181" class="citation">[181]</a>)&nbsp; He walked
up every day to Norman Cross, and acted very charitably to the
prisoners, doing his utmost to stop their frequent duels.&nbsp;
It is to be hoped that <i>ere long more will be known of this
worthy prelate</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Godwin&rsquo;s wish was soon fulfilled.&nbsp; Two years
after this was written there came to light, among the family
archives at Milton, near Peterborough, the correspondence which
the author is able to print verbatim in the appendix, through the
kind permission of Mr. George Wentworth Fitzwilliam, the
greatgrandson of <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>the fourth Earl Fitzwilliam, to whom the Bishop&rsquo;s
letters are addressed, and who is the present owner of the
estates and head of the Northamptonshire branch of the
family.&nbsp; This correspondence, with other information
gathered from scanty but authentic sources, enables the writer to
put before his readers a picture of the one priest of whose work
at Norman Cross the memory remained in the neighbourhood for more
than a generation after the Depot was destroyed.&nbsp; The
correspondence is of interest as throwing light on other matters
also.</p>
<p>The first part of this correspondence consists of letters from
the Bishop of Moulins begging for pecuniary assistance and for
another favour from Lord Fitzwilliam, with an accompanying
document of great interest&mdash;viz. a condensed autobiography
of the Bishop, and the unfinished draft of the Earl&rsquo;s
reply; these are all in French.&nbsp; The last mentioned is
interesting, as it shows incidentally that the great Whig Earl
sympathised with the Bishop in his loyalty to the Bourbons, to
whom he was devoted, and in his firm resolve never to acknowledge
the government of the Emperor Napoleon, whom he regarded as an
usurper.&nbsp; It also gives first-hand information as to an
outside matter, the enormous cost of the famous Yorkshire
Election, in which the respective heads in the West Riding of the
contesting Whigs and Tories, Lord Fitzwilliam and Lord Harewood,
each represented by his own son, kept open house for the fifteen
days during which the Poll lasted, Lord Milton, the Whig,
beating, by a majority of 188, his Tory rival, the Hon. Henry
Lascelles. <a name="citation182"></a><a href="#footnote182"
class="citation">[182]</a>&nbsp; The condensed autobiography sent
by the Bishop to Lord Fitzwilliam upsets much that has been
written to accentuate the saintly character which has been, not
altogether without reason, <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>attributed to him.&nbsp; The
remaining letters, one of which has been introduced in the text
in connection with the straw-plait trade, refer to the
application made by the Bishop for the release of another
prisoner to take the place of his servant Jean Baptiste
David.</p>
<p>The autobiography is practically that of an
&eacute;migr&eacute;, although the Bishop-designate was a
&ldquo;d&eacute;port&eacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most of these
aristocrats, ecclesiastics, and others who fled from France at a
time when, had they possessed the courage to remain, they might
have much altered the course of events, took refuge in Austria,
Italy, and other continental Catholic countries.&nbsp;
Comparatively few came to England.&nbsp; From the Bishop we learn
that in 1791, having been designated Bishop of Moulins, he was
expelled from France.&nbsp; He took refuge in Italy, where he had
the good fortune to become Chief Chaplain to the Bourbon
Princess, Victoire of France, &ldquo;to whose bounty he owed his
existence,&rdquo; and at her death, in 1799, he was left
absolutely without any resources.&nbsp; Under these circumstances
he came to England, where he received the allowance granted to
bishops at that time, &pound;10 a month.&nbsp; In his narrative
the Bishop enters into further details as to his
misfortunes.&nbsp; He found his relatives in London in distress;
he advanced them moneys which he obtained from money-lenders, who
made the loans on the security of his expectations&mdash;<a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>expectations which came to nothing.&nbsp; When the
Bishop&rsquo;s father died, leaving a goodly inheritance, the
whole was appropriated by his relatives, who took advantage of
the Bishop&rsquo;s absence from France.&nbsp; His brother
suggested to him that if he would return to France and submit to
the Government, they might help him.&nbsp; This the Bishop would
never do, his devotion and loyalty to the Bourbons made it
impossible, and in 1808 he is found at Stilton writing a begging
letter from the Bell Inn&mdash;not there &ldquo;out of pure
compassion for his imprisoned countrymen,&rdquo; but a
&ldquo;d&eacute;port&eacute;&rdquo; from France, who, when he
arrived in England, was without any resources beyond his great
expectations, on the strength of which the Bishop was able to
obtain money from usurers, to one of whom this unfortunate
prelate was paying 30 per cent. per annum for a loan of
&pound;200.&nbsp; He was not &ldquo;living on his own charges and
upon remittances from France,&rdquo; but upon &pound;240 a year
paid to him by the British Government.</p>
<p>To this payment by the British Government was added the
extraordinary privilege of the liberation of a lad from Norman
Cross to act as his servant.&nbsp; This was a further favour from
the Government which was feeding him and clothing him.&nbsp; The
Bishop&rsquo;s return for these acts of grace was to allow the
lad to join in the illegal straw-plait traffic, and then to make
the application which, reading between the lines of Sir Rupert
George&rsquo;s letter, it was easy to see was regarded by the
Transport Board as a gross piece of effrontery.&nbsp; The sequel
was more letters in the effusive begging-letter style of a
century ago to the tender-hearted, influential nobleman whose
acquaintance he had made, and the ultimate granting of another
servant.</p>
<p>In one of his letters the Bishop denies that there is any
truth in the accusation that his servant was an accomplice in the
illicit trading in straw plait, and there is no extant evidence
that he was so; but it is <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>clear, from the correspondence
between the Transport Board and the Secretary to the Admiralty,
and between the latter and Earl Fitzwilliam, that the Transport
Board had no doubt about the fact.</p>
<p>There is something pathetic in the fact that these letters, in
his, the Bishop&rsquo;s, beautiful handwriting, which is like the
finest engrossing, but so small that it is scarcely legible
without the aid of a magnifying-glass, should have come to light
exactly 100 years after they were written, and only two years
after the wish had been expressed by the writers quoted above,
that more could be learned of &ldquo;this worthy prelate&rdquo;
and &ldquo;this good man,&rdquo; for in them the Bishop himself
rises up to cast off the adornments of self-sacrifice, etc., with
which he has been decorated by his biographers.</p>
<p>Divers writers, one after another, have attributed to him the
qualifications of a saint, finding everything he did so good and
wonderful, that the last, the late Rev. M. C. Godwin, mentions as
a merit that the Bishop walked a mile to his duties at the
prison.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown, in the footnote just quoted, says: &ldquo;It would
be interesting to know the history of this good man after the
prisoners were discharged in 1814.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s association with Norman Cross entitles him
to a prominent place in this narrative, and such further
particulars of his life as have after much research been
established add something to the little that is known of the
&eacute;migr&eacute;s and the d&eacute;port&eacute;s who took
refuge in England.</p>
<p>Without the halo of a saint, the Bishop is still revealed as a
good priest winning the hearts and the esteem of those among whom
he ministered, seeking to lighten the lot of the prisoners who
were his flock.&nbsp; What light is thrown on his character by
the legend written against the boys&rsquo; prison on the prisoner
Foulley&rsquo;s model of the Norman Cross Depot, in the
<i>Invalides</i>! <a name="citation185"></a><a
href="#footnote185" class="citation">[185]</a> <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>(<i>vide</i> Plate XX, p. 251).&nbsp; The Bishop was
working when many another ecclesiastical emigrant was idle, and
there is every reason to believe that he was worthy of his hire,
as far as his work was concerned.&nbsp; Probably the advent of
the Bishop to Norman Cross did for the prisoners what
Buonaparte&rsquo;s reinstatement of religion did for the
population of France.&nbsp; The correspondence shows that it was
his strong political opinions, his stedfast loyalty to the House
of Bourbon, strengthened as it was by gratitude and affection,
and his determined refusal to accept office on the terms of the
Concordat, and to swear fealty to the Emperor, whom he regarded
as a usurper, which kept him in England as a mere
Bishop-designate instead of a consecrated endowed Bishop.&nbsp;
So strong were his feelings on these points, that he was one of
the ecclesiastics who signed the Remonstrance against the
Concordat and thus incurred the Pope&rsquo;s displeasure.</p>
<p>Outside his office there is good ground for believing that he
was an accomplished and learned man, with a fine presence and
attractive, courteous manners. <a name="citation186"></a><a
href="#footnote186" class="citation">[186]</a>&nbsp; He was
apparently <i>persona grata</i> at Milton, the residence of Earl
Fitzwilliam, seven miles from Stilton.&nbsp; But the
correspondence reveals the Bishop as a normally imperfect
man.&nbsp; In the opinion of the authorities (with which the
historian must agree) he abused the extraordinary privileges
granted to him by the British Government, and on his own showing
he was, to say the least of it, injudicious in the management of
his affairs.&nbsp; He incurred heavy debts to money-lenders
without any certain prospect of being able to repay them.&nbsp;
In extenuation of these financial errors, it may be said that
misfortune and over-generosity, not personal extravagance, <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>led to his
impecuniosity and his dealings with usurers, and as to the
Bishop&rsquo;s connivance in the matter of his servant taking up
as his occupation illicit dealing in the straw plait made in the
prison, Earl Fitzwilliam clearly did not regard it as a heinous
offence, when it was brought before his notice by Lord Mulgrave,
but continued his pleading for the Bishop, and eventually
succeeded in obtaining for him the favour he craved.</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s work at Norman Cross continued until he
returned with the Bourbons to France after the banishment of
Buonaparte to Elba in 1814.&nbsp; Several articles in the
Peterborough Museum are described in the catalogue as presents
from grateful prisoners to the Bishop.&nbsp; If they were, it
would be interesting to know why he left them behind instead of
taking them to France when he returned.</p>
<p>From other sources we gather that the Rt. Rev. Etienne Jean
Baptist, Louis de Galois de la Tour, who was fifty-four years of
age at the date of the correspondence, <a
name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187"
class="citation">[187]</a> was an ecclesiastic of great
distinction.&nbsp; He was the son of Charles Jean Baptist de
Galois de la Tour, who was French Administrator in 1788 at
Moulins and first President of the Department of Aix, where the
future Archbishop was born in 1754.&nbsp; He became Vicar-general
of the See of Autun and doyen of the College of St. Pierre at
Moulins.&nbsp; He had been designated to the See of Moulins, when
in 1791 the order for his arrest was issued, and he was
&ldquo;d&eacute;port&eacute;&rdquo; according to the official
list of &eacute;migr&eacute;s published in Paris in 1793.&nbsp;
In the Bishop&rsquo;s own narrative he says,
&ldquo;L&rsquo;&Eacute;v&ecirc;que de Moulins, parti de France en
1791.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of his life and fortunes from that year until
1808 we have his own account.&nbsp; In 1814, after twenty-three
years of exile, he returned with the Bourbons to France, but he
was not at once consecrated or even appointed to the See of
Moulins.</p>
<p>His attitude towards the Pope and the French <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Government
during his banishment can be seen in three rare pamphlets
published in London in 1802 and 1803. <a
name="citation188a"></a><a href="#footnote188a"
class="citation">[188a]</a>&nbsp; The Pope (Pius VII.) was
remonstrated with for coming to terms with the French
Government.&nbsp; To the first remonstrance, dated 23rd December
1801, one archbishop and twelve bishops affix their signatures,
to which a cross is prefixed; Etienne de la Tour signs last, as
nominated Bishop of Moulins, without the cross.&nbsp; In April
1803 he signs at the end of three archbishops and thirty-five
bishops, this time with a cross. <a name="citation188b"></a><a
href="#footnote188b" class="citation">[188b]</a>&nbsp; The
history of the quarrel between the parties and final
reconciliation can be seen in Thiers: <i>History of the French
Revolution</i> (Shobul&rsquo;s Trans.), 1895, vol. i., pp.
105&ndash;6, 145, 187.</p>
<p>After some correspondence and an acknowledgment of his error
the Bishop-designate was consecrated, and two years later he was
elevated to the archbishopric of Bourges.</p>
<p>The Archbishop did not live more than four years to occupy the
lofty position which he had won by his personal attributes, by
his fidelity to the House of Bourbon, by his services to the
Church, by his twenty-three years&rsquo; banishment from France
involuntary and voluntary, by his experiences at Norman Cross, <a
name="citation188c"></a><a href="#footnote188c"
class="citation">[188c]</a> among which the little incident of
his association, through Jean Baptiste David, with the
straw-plait smuggling business might, by the Roman Catholic
hierarchy and even by the Bourbon Government, not be reckoned as
otherwise than meritorious.</p>
<p>The Archbishop, who had for so many years lived at Stilton on
a pittance allowed by the British Government, <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>and had
served his fellow countrymen within the walls of the Norman Cross
Prison, died in his palace at Bourges on 20th March 1820.</p>
<p>No evidence has been procured, beyond the statement of the
relative of the Rev. T. Hinde (p. 176), that, at any time, a
Protestant clergyman was officially appointed as chaplain to the
Depot.&nbsp; There is, however, sufficient evidence that, during
the first period of the war, between the opening of the prison
(1797) and its evacuation (1802), the services of Roman Catholic
priests were accepted, a record existing that two priests were
for a short time allowed to reside within the walls.&nbsp; After
the resumption of hostilities in 1803, notwithstanding the very
strong directions issued to Captain Pressland, on the reopening
of the prison, that &ldquo;no priests were to be admitted except
in extreme cases, etc.,&rdquo; we find the Bishop-designate of
Moulins practically established as the priest ministering to his
countrymen in captivity, and living on the income derived from
the British Government.</p>
<p>The fact that the Vicar-general of Mans and the
Bishop-designate of Moulins differed in their politics from the
bulk of the prisoners probably led to their obtaining from the
British Government the privilege of thus exercising their
office&mdash;a privilege not apparently without its pecuniary
advantages to themselves, for the Bishop in his autobiography
tells us that on coming to London he received from the British
Government the sum of &pound;10 a month, the usual allowance to a
man of his rank, while at Stilton the sum paid to him is doubled,
and he has &pound;240 a year.</p>
<p>On the whole, the records of this chapter in the history of
Norman Cross, if painful to our national pride and self-respect
in many details, would probably not be regarded in the same light
by those who, a century since, were engaged in and suffering from
this prolonged, sanguinary, bitter, and costly war.</p>

<i>Histories</i>, xxxiv. 49.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> conditions of life for
prisoners out on parole have hitherto not been considered.&nbsp;
In more chivalrous days a prisoner on parole was allowed to live
free in his own country, pledged only on his word of honour to
take part in no action which should be directly or indirectly
hostile to the country which had captured him.&nbsp; The spirit
of animosity and mistrust which animated the combatants in the
struggle which filled with captives Norman Cross and other
prisons in both countries, would certainly admit no such
arrangement as this, although M. Otto, the French Commissary in
London, suggested it, either satirically or knowing that, if
accepted, the arrangement would mean that while England would
receive back only 5,000, France would receive 22,000.</p>
<p>M. Otto&rsquo;s words were:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If the scarcity of provisions is so
notorious that the Government&rdquo; (the British Government),
&ldquo;notwithstanding its solicitude cannot relieve the wants of
its <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>people, why should the Government unnecessarily
increase the consumption, by feeding more than 22,000
individuals?&nbsp; I have already had the honour of laying before
you, Two Proposals on this Subject, namely, that of ransoming the
Prisoners, or that of sending them back to France on
Parole.&nbsp; Either of these alternatives would afford an
efficient remedy for the evil in question; the plan of Parole has
already been adopted with respect to French Fishermen.&rdquo; <a
name="citation191a"></a><a href="#footnote191a"
class="citation">[191a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proposal was not likely to be accepted, and the great
bulk of the prisoners in both countries remained in strict
durance throughout the war.&nbsp; Those who were allowed on
parole were naval and military officers, commanders and first
lieutenants of privateers mounting fourteen guns, <a
name="citation191b"></a><a href="#footnote191b"
class="citation">[191b]</a> commanders and first mates of
merchantmen, and non-combatants.&nbsp; These latter, in the
second period of the war, constituted a considerable proportion
of the parole prisoners.&nbsp; One of the first duties imposed by
the regulations for the guidance of the agents at the various
prisons was that when a fresh party of prisoners arrived, he
should go thoroughly into the question of the rank, social
condition, employment, and character of each man, in order to
determine who were qualified to go on parole, and the captain of
the ship in which the prisoners had been taken was expected to
send such information as he could to enable the agents to carry
out this duty.</p>
<p>The last sentence of the passage quoted from M. Otto&rsquo;s
letter to the Transport Board shows that for one class of
non-combatants, the French fishermen, the <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>British
Government had adopted the plan of returning them to France.</p>
<p>A note in the register of the soldiers received at Norman
Cross states that with certain chasseurs fran&ccedil;ais who
arrived at the prison on 9th September 1809, arrived two women
and a child.&nbsp; How they were disposed of between that date
and 24th December of the same year, when they were discharged to
France, is not recorded.&nbsp; One of the women got only as far
as Lynn on her way home, and in the following March returned to
Norman Cross; her further adventures are not recorded.</p>
<p>The numbers of those on parole varied greatly in the course of
the war.&nbsp; In the year 1796, in which the building of Norman
Cross was commenced, the number was 1,200; on 30th April 1810,
out of a total of 44,583 prisoners, 2,710; and on 11th June 1811,
out of 49,132 prisoners, 3,193.&nbsp; The number on parole would
greatly increase as more prisoners passed into the country.&nbsp;
The Duke of Wellington, in one of his despatches dated 23rd
December 1812, summarising the result of the campaign in Spain,
mentions that &ldquo;In the months which have elapsed since
January, this army has sent to England little short of 20,000
prisoners.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of these many came to Norman Cross.&nbsp;
The number continued to increase until the total in Britain
reached 67,000, that being the number returned to France after
the Treaty of Paris was signed on 30th May 1814.</p>
<p>The prisoners on parole were widely distributed in various
towns, many of them distant from any large depot. <a
name="citation192"></a><a href="#footnote192"
class="citation">[192]</a>&nbsp; Agents were appointed in each
place to look <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>after and pay the prisoners who lodged either in the
town itself or in the neighbouring villages.&nbsp; Of the 1,200
on parole in 1797, 100 were in Peterborough and its
neighbourhood, and the agent who accepted the responsibility of
looking after them, paying them and mustering them at stated
intervals when they had to report themselves to him, was Mr.
Thomas Squire, a merchant and banker living in the Bridge House,
in whose field, on the river bank, the second batch of prisoners
consigned to Norman Cross in April 1797 landed from the barges
which had brought them from Lynn.&nbsp; The only parole register
relating to Peterborough which the author could find in the
Record Office is a volume dating from 1795 to 1800, and refers
mainly to the Dutch.&nbsp; In this volume there are entered,
between 10th November 1797 and 3rd July 1800, the names of 100
Dutch prisoners on parole at Peterborough.&nbsp; The <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>first
French were the captain, four lieutenants, the purser, surgeon,
and first pilot of <i>La Jalouse</i>, in June 1797.</p>
<p>No corresponding record has been found as to the disposal of
those who arrived at Norman Cross in the second period of the
war, 1803&ndash;15, and who by their rank or social status were
entitled to parole.&nbsp; It is probable that on the officer who
received them at the port where they landed, devolved the duty of
selecting the parole prisoners and sending them direct to the
towns where they were to be interned when the general body of
prisoners went to Norman Cross.</p>
<p>From the general register of the prisoners at Norman Cross
between 1803 and 1810 we can, however, gather a few notes which
sufficiently indicate that the custom was <i>not</i> to allocate
them in the immediate neighbourhood, but at more distant depots
for parole prisoners.&nbsp; Thus we find that Jean Casquar, a
boatswain&rsquo;s mate, was sent to Tiverton; Antoine
Sivi&eacute;, a passenger, to Leek; Pierre Kervain, a servant on
parole, to Ashbourne; Eustache, a black, to Ashbourne; Jean C. Le
Prince, a clerk, to Montgomery; Captain Nicholas Lanceraux to
Lichfield; Jean Maistey, second mate on a privateer, with three
passengers taken in the same ship, to Leek.&nbsp; Then a more
complicated transaction is shown: Louis Feyssier, a passenger on
parole at Leek, was sent to Norman Cross, it being noted that he
had not previously been there; he was probably sent for
imprisonment, as a punishment for breach of his parole at
Leek.</p>
<p>Another transaction helps us to learn what was going on at
home in the long years of this terrible war, when only high
polities and the military and naval events beyond our bounds were
occupying the pens of historical writers.&nbsp; Captain A.
Strazynski escaped with a midshipman from Ashbourne in September
1810.&nbsp; The pair of them were retaken at Chesterfield, whence
they <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>were sent to the Norman Cross Prison, where they
arrived on 10th December of the same year.&nbsp; Again, Ensign
Louis Pineau escaped from Greenlaw.&nbsp; He made his way south,
until he was retaken and lodged in Northampton Gaol, whence he
was sent to Norman Cross.</p>
<p>These are almost all the notes bearing on the question of the
parole prisoners which occur in the register.</p>
<p>As has been already mentioned, these registers are very
incomplete, and the notes and remarks are few and far between,
but there is one long note dealing with the practice of one
prisoner assuming the name of another.&nbsp; This was sometimes
done with the object of establishing a man&rsquo;s right to have
the privileges of parole.&nbsp; One instance noted is that of a
man entered as Mathuren Nazarean, his real name being Pierre
Dussage; the assumed name was that of the first lieutenant of the
<i>Alerte</i>, who was left ill at Lisbon.&nbsp; Dussage hoped to
pass himself off as the lieutenant, and thus to be allowed out on
parole.</p>
<p>No record has been found of the precise distribution in the
town and the surrounding villages of the 100 prisoners registered
as on parole in Peterborough.&nbsp; On 25th November 1797 the
whole of the prisoners on parole in England were ordered, without
any distinction of rank whatever, to be imprisoned at Norman
Cross.&nbsp; For the sick and the baggage, covered conveyances
were provided.&nbsp; The others of all ranks marched to the
Depot, some of them hundreds of miles.&nbsp; This step was taken
in part fulfilment of the threat already referred to in Chapter
V., which had been held out against the French as a means of
compelling them to clothe their own countrymen in the English
prisons, and to withdraw their opposition to certain proposals of
the English Government as to the terms of Exchange, and
especially as to the restoration of Captain Sir Sydney Smith,
whose liberation no expostulations of the Government could
obtain.</p>
<p>In the later plans of the Depot is seen one block in <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>the
south-east quadrangle fenced off for the officers&rsquo;
prison.&nbsp; It was probably in this block, or in No. 13 in the
north-eastern quadrangle, that Jean de la Porte executed his
wonderful straw marquetry pictures.&nbsp; At what date the order
for the reincarceration of the officers was cancelled has not
been ascertained, but it is certain that their close confinement
was not of long duration, and that the privileges of parole were
soon restored.&nbsp; This was, however, not the only occasion
when such an order was issued, and when the prisoners on parole
were placed in close confinement.&nbsp; Parole was very
frequently broken by the French officers, and a considerable
number were successful in making their escape.&nbsp; Those who
failed to do so or were recaptured were severely treated.&nbsp;
In extreme cases, such as repeated breaking of parole, officers
were sent to the hulks.&nbsp; A cadet of the <i>Utrecht</i>,
Dutch man-of-war, who broke his parole at Tenterden, when
recaptured was sent to the hulks at Chatham.&nbsp; Unless there
had been some gross misconduct, this punishment cannot fail to be
regarded by some as unduly harsh.&nbsp; On the other hand, it
must not be forgotten that the full term was <i>parole
d&rsquo;honneur</i>.&nbsp; The word of honour of an officer was
assumed to be of a specially binding character; the poor,
ignorant soldier or sailor was not trusted, the officer was,
because his &ldquo;word of honour&rdquo; was deemed
binding.&nbsp; In addition, the officer signed a document
corresponding to the following parole paper, which was the form
used for a prisoner restored on parole to France.&nbsp; This
constituted a legal document.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>Form of Parole
Engagement</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas the Commissioners for conducting His Britannic
Majesty&rsquo;s Transport Service, and for the Care and Custody
of Prisoners of War, have been pleased to grant me, the
undersigned . . . . . . as described on <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>the back
thereof, late . . . . . . and now a Prisoner of War, leave to
return to France, upon my entering into an Engagement not to
serve against Great Britain, or any of the Powers in Alliance
with that Kingdom, until I shall be regularly exchanged for a
British Prisoner of War, of equal Rank; and upon my also
engaging, that immediately after my Arrival in France, I shall
make known the Place of my Residence there, to the British Agent
for Prisoners in Paris, and shall not change the same on any
account, without first intimating my intention to the said Agent;
and moreover, that at the Expiration of every Two Months, until
my exchange shall be effected, I shall regularly and punctually
transmit to the said Agent, a Certificate of my Residence, signed
by the Magistrates or Municipal Officers of the Place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, in Consideration of my Engagement, I do hereby
declare that I have given my Parole of Honour accordingly, and
that I will keep it inviolable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given under my Hand at . . . . . . this . . . . . . Day
of 17 . . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On back</i>, Name, Rank, Age, Stature, Person,
Visage, Complexion, Hair, Eyes, Marks or Wounds, etc.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further it must be borne in mind that military punishments are
more severe than civil; they follow more rapidly the crime.&nbsp;
A breach of parole was a military crime as well as a civil
offence, for which loss of liberty on a Chatham hulk was perhaps
a fitting punishment.&nbsp; By Clause 4 of Rules to be observed
by the prisoners of war in Great Britain, Ireland,
etc.&mdash;rules with which all prisoners, whether in captivity
or on parole, were familiar&mdash;very severe punishment for any
escaped prisoner who was retaken was laid down for every
class.&nbsp; In the case of officers escaping, it was enacted
that if recaptured they &ldquo;shall from that time be considered
and treated in all respects like common <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>men.&rdquo;&nbsp; An officer on parole who escapes, not
only escapes, but he breaks his word of honour, and he therefore
merits a more severe punishment than he who only breaks his
prison bars and does nothing dishonourable.</p>
<p>Both the French and British Governments, to their credit, were
ever ready to deal generously and even magnanimously in the way
of exchange or release as a reward for some uncalled-for act of
bravery or kindness on the part of prisoners in connection with
their captors.&nbsp; The following are a few out of many such
instances: In December 1811, twenty-one English prisoners were
released for assisting to extinguish a fire at Auxonne; among
these was the mate of an English merchant vessel, and for him the
mate of the French vessel <i>Achille</i> was released from
Lichfield, he having assisted to put out a fire there.&nbsp; The
colonel of the (French) 36th Regiment was allowed to go to France
on parole to try to effect the exchange of Colonel Cox, and
failing this to return in three months.&nbsp; In December 1810,
Captain Bourde, of the French ship <i>Neptune</i>, was released
in consequence of his humanity to the officers and crew of the
<i>Comet</i>, a ship in the East India Company&rsquo;s
service.&nbsp; A French surgeon detained on the prison ship
<i>Assistance</i>, at Portsmouth, was exchanged &ldquo;in
consequence of his attention to the British sick soldiers on
board the <i>Spence</i> transport as represented by Lieut. J. W.
Lloyd of the 8th King&rsquo;s Regiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; A French
captain of the land forces being taken prisoner, was allowed to
return to France &ldquo;for his meritorious conduct in saving the
life of a British officer in the last war.&rdquo;&nbsp; Five
French officers were released from Andover &ldquo;for their
exertions in extinguishing a fire at that town.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
naval lieutenant was released by Admiralty order &ldquo;for
saving a child&rsquo;s life from a lion at Oswestry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In April 1812, Pierre Marie Tong was released from Portsmouth
&ldquo;in consideration <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>of services offered by his father to
assist the <i>Conquisador</i> when on shore on the coast of
France.&rdquo;&nbsp; About the same date the second captain and
clerk of a privateer obtained their liberty &ldquo;for saving the
lives of seventy-nine British seamen wrecked on the
coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor were these courtesies confined to officers.&nbsp; A
seaman, prisoner at Plymouth, was to be exchanged &ldquo;for
having leaped overboard and saved the life of Alexander Muir on
board the <i>Brave</i>, as per letter 3rd June (1810) from
Captain Hawkins.&rdquo;&nbsp; A number of Lascars, prisoners at
Dunkirk, were exchanged for seamen at Norman Cross, the second
captain for two, and the captain at Chatham was considered worth
three Lascars.&nbsp; We have, in Appendix B, alluded to the
release of Captain Woodriff.&nbsp; These bright examples serve to
illuminate what is otherwise a gloomy episode.</p>
<p>The allowance paid by the British Government to the officers
on parole was at first only 1<i>s.</i> a day.&nbsp; This was
increased to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; but even that amount,
although more than was paid by the French to the English
prisoners on parole in France, was altogether inadequate, owing
to the greater expense of living in England.&nbsp; The inferior
officers and others received only 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The
French scale varied from 7<i>s.</i> a day for a General to
10<i>d.</i> a day for officers of merchantmen.&nbsp; Frequent
complaints being made of the insufficiency of the English
allowance, M. Riviere, of the French Admiralty, who nine years
before denied the right of our Government to inquire into the
treatment of British prisoners in France, adding, &ldquo;that it
(the treatment) was the will of the Emperor,&rdquo; wrote a long
letter to the Transport Board on the subject, stating that the
cost at which an English officer could live in France was
9<i>d.</i> a day, while for a similar provision in England, a
French officer must pay 2<i>s.</i> a day.&nbsp; The Board called
upon Lieut. Wallis, who had recently escaped from France, to
check each item by the market prices of provisions in France <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>and in
England, and he arrived at the following comparison:</p>

</table>
<p>It therefore appeared clear that the least an officer could
live on was 2<i>s.</i> a day in England and 1<i>s.</i> a day in
France.&nbsp; To double the allowance to the French officers in
England would, it was estimated, cost the Government
&pound;43,823, and ultimately it was decided to increase the
allowance to 2<i>s.</i> for the higher ranks, coming down to
1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in the lower, at an increased cost of
&pound;28,000 a year.&nbsp; When invalided, the prisoners
received an extra allowance, and were attended by doctors
practising in their neighbourhood selected by, and paid by, the
Government.&nbsp; Their allowance was doubled when a <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>nurse was
required.&nbsp; These extra charges were borne by the
Commissioners for the Care of the Sick and Hurt, not by the
Transport Board.</p>
<p>The majority of the officers on parole were not entirely
dependent on the allowance received from the British Government,
their income being supplemented by remittances sent from
France.</p>
<p>Several of the officers of high rank, and other prisoners
whose means enabled them to do so, sent for their wives and lived
comfortably in lodgings.&nbsp; Judging from the traditions of the
Norman Cross district, and from the literature of the period, the
presence of the prisoners on parole made but little change in the
social life of the towns and villages in which they were
quartered, not sufficient to leave an enduring impression.&nbsp;
This is strange, for the presence of 100 foreigners of varying
social position in and round about a quiet little cathedral city,
such as Peterborough was a century ago, must certainly have
modified the usual routine of the social life of its citizens,
and of the dwellers in the neighbouring villages in which some of
the prisoners lodged.</p>
<p>Although the bitter antagonism which existed between the
French and the British during this long war would militate
against it, there is no doubt that occasionally the prisoners on
parole visited and formed friendships, and even attachments,
among their neighbours according to their degree.&nbsp; This
general statement made to the writer by his parents and other
nonagenarians is borne out by the marriages to be mentioned
directly, but although the writer has lived in Peterborough,
excepting the few years when his education took him away, for
three-quarters of a century, he does not recollect ever to have
heard of any special instance of the survival of such a
friendship in the city or in the immediate neighbourhood of
Norman Cross, excepting those to be detailed when the marriages
of the prisoners are dealt with.</p>
<p><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>It
has been thought not irrelevant to the history of Norman Cross to
devote the succeeding chapter to the subject of the English
Prisoners in France, and it will be there seen that in the letter
written by Lieut. Tucker from Verdun, he specially says,
&ldquo;there is no society between the English and the
French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When in 1814 Napoleon abdicated, and the Treaty of Paris was
signed on the 30th May, some 70,000 French prisoners, of whom
nearly 4,000 were out on parole, together with hundreds of
&eacute;migr&eacute;s, left our shores.&nbsp; These friendships
and close associations were abruptly cut short, and the foreign
element in British Society appears to have been speedily
forgotten.&nbsp; The intimacies which were kept up, of which we
read in the biographies and family archives of those who lived in
the first half of the last century, were almost all between the
British and the French &eacute;migr&eacute;, not between the
British and the prisoners on parole; they were between persons
who, although of different nationalities, agreed in their
political sympathies, and who were equally opposed to the
existing French Government.</p>
<p>Between 1793 and 1814 about 200,000 Frenchmen and other
foreigners (at various periods, not all at one time), either in
durance or on parole, spent a longer or shorter period of their
lives in Great Britain.&nbsp; In the second period of the war
(1803&ndash;15) there were 122,440, and of these probably 4,000
at least were out on parole, including in this estimate not only
the commissioned officers, but also the large number of officers
of privateers and of civilians of various occupations who were
all reckoned as prisoners of war. <a name="citation202"></a><a
href="#footnote202" class="citation">[202]</a></p>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>A
comparison of the Census Returns and the official returns as to
prisoners of war for the year 1810 justifies the conclusion that
about 2 per cent. of the adult males in Great Britain of the
average age of the prisoners must have been Frenchmen.&nbsp; Of
this 2 per cent., the great majority were, as has been already
stated, in confinement; but as those on parole were not scattered
broadcast throughout the country, but were concentrated in the
various towns enumerated in the footnote to page 192, they would
in these towns constitute a far larger proportion <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>than 2 per
cent. of the men of their own age.&nbsp; In Peterborough the 100
parole prisoners would be about 15 per cent. of their
contemporaries in the town and neighbourhood.&nbsp; It is strange
that this considerable element of French in the society of that
period figures so little in the pages of contemporary authors who
deal with social matters.&nbsp; In explanation it must be borne
in mind that the allowance of the Government to the prisoners on
parole was only sufficient for a bare living, and that, except in
the case of those with good private means, these officers would
have to be very economical in their choice of lodgings, and would
be thrown chiefly into the society of persons who were by their
circumstances compelled to let cheap lodgings.&nbsp; The
prisoners would form a little circle among themselves.</p>
<p>Mr. John T. Thorp has with infinite pains gone into the
question of how far Free Masonry brought the parole prisoners
into association with their brethren of the craft. <a
name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204"
class="citation">[204]</a>&nbsp; The result of his investigations
is that, although in eleven of the towns in which parole
prisoners were detained&mdash;viz. Abergavenny,
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leek, Melrose, Northampton, Plymouth,
Sanquhar, Tiverton, Penicuik, Wantage, and Wincanton&mdash;French
Lodges were established by the prisoners resident in the towns or
their neighbourhood, only in four is there any evidence of
association with British masons.&nbsp; In <i>Abergavenny</i> two
English became members of the Lodge.&nbsp; In <i>Melrose</i> the
members of the French Lodge joined with the Brethren of the
Scotch Lodge in the ceremonial of the laying of the first stone
of a public reservoir, and among the archives of the Scotch Lodge
was a memorial presented by twenty of the members of the French
Lodge expressing their gratitude for the fraternal manner in
which they had uniformly been treated by the Brethren of the
Melrose Lodge.</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>In
<i>Wantage</i>, the Lodge &ldquo;Cours unis&rdquo; was formed by
the prisoners, and when seven members were transferred to Kelso,
it is recorded that they were received as visitors by the Scotch
Lodge in that town.</p>
<p>At <i>Wincanton</i> (&ldquo;La Paix
d&eacute;sir&eacute;e&rdquo;) two certificates were granted to
Englishmen, one as a joining member and the other as an
initiate.</p>
<p>Very little more evidence is found in the minutes of the
English Lodges.&nbsp; At <i>Ashburton</i> is the record of the
Initiation of a Frenchman.&nbsp; At <i>Selkirk</i> twenty-three
parole prisoners who were masons were enrolled as members of the
Lodge, and they were allowed the use of the Lodge Room for their
own business and ceremonies.</p>
<p>At <i>Northampton</i>, in the neighbouring county to that in
which Norman Cross is situated, a French Lodge (&ldquo;La Bonne
Union&rdquo;) was established, but there is no tradition of any
association with the English Brethren.</p>
<p>At <i>Ashby-de-la-Zouch</i> a French Lodge was formed, but
there is no record of any intercourse with the English
Brethren.&nbsp; Ashby was a large depot for parole prisoners,
some 200 being located in the town and neighbourhood, and there
is a tradition that the French Lodge of Freemasons gave a ball to
which they invited many of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>One reason why the Brethren of the French and English nations
apparently associated to such a small extent, is that the British
masons would, as a rule, regard the French Lodges as irregular
and self-constituted, they having no mandate from the Grandmaster
of England or Scotland.</p>
<p>In Peterborough there is no record or tradition of a French
Lodge.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorp, in the little history from which these facts are
drawn, mentions the marriage of a member of the French Lodge at
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Brother Louis Jan to a Miss Edwards, in
1809.&nbsp; The couple went to <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>France in 1814, returned to England
for some years, but went back to Rouen, where M. Jan died.&nbsp;
His widow came back to Ashby, where she supported herself and her
children by teaching French.&nbsp; She died in 1867.</p>
<p>As regards the parole prisoners whose headquarters were at
Peterborough, a careful search through the marriage register of
St. John&rsquo;s Church has failed to discover an entry of any
marriage which can be identified as that of a French prisoner and
English girl; but in the years 1800&ndash;01 five marriages
between Dutch prisoners and English girls were celebrated in the
church and duly registered.</p>
<p>The first three bridegrooms were young officers, who were
married on the eve of their restoration to liberty under the
terms of the Convention of Alkmaar.&nbsp; From the register of
Dutch Prisoners of War in the Record Office, we have been able to
identify these bridegrooms.&nbsp; In the Parish Church Register
there is absolutely no hint that the bridegrooms were prisoners
of war.&nbsp; The names only are given, without any description,
although the statement that there are entries of French
prisoners, designated as such, in this marriage register having
been once made, has been adopted time after time by writers and
lecturers on this subject.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; On the 17th February 1800, Albertus Coeymans was
married to Ann Whitwell.&nbsp; Witnesses who signed the register,
B. Pletsz and James Gibbs.&nbsp; James Gibbs appears to have been
the Parish Clerk, who usually witnessed the marriages.&nbsp; From
the register in the Record Office we find that Albertus Coeymans
was 2nd Lieutenant in the <i>Furie</i>, was captured when the
ship was taken, received at Norman Cross 19th November 1798, and
&ldquo;discharged to Holland&rdquo; 19th February 1800.&nbsp; The
witness B. Pletsz was Captain of the <i>Furie</i>, and was
received at Norman Cross on the same date as the Lieutenant.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; On the 17th February 1800, Adrian Roeland <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>Robberts
Roelans was married to Mary Kingston.&nbsp; Witnesses, Joseph
Little and James Gibbs.&nbsp; Mr. Roelans was a midshipman on the
<i>Jupiter</i>, and was received at Norman Cross, with others of
the captured crew, on the 4th November 1797, being released on
parole twelve days after his reception.&nbsp; It is interesting
to note that the witness at this wedding was not another Dutch
officer, but Mr. Joseph Little of Thorpe, in which hamlet Miss
Kingston resided.&nbsp; That the marriage of his friend was
satisfactory to this witness, and that the intimacy between them
was kept up after the liberation of the midshipman under the
Alkmaar Cartel, may be accepted as established by an entry in the
register nine years later of the marriage of Joseph Little of
Thorpe to Mary Roelans, probably the sister of his friend the
midshipman captured on the <i>Jupiter</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph Little remained at home with his Dutch bride, and
as far as can be traced through the complicated connections of
the large clan of Littles, the blood of Roelans still runs in the
blood of several of them.&nbsp; A brother of Mr. Little&rsquo;s
had married a sister of the Miss Kingston who became the wife of
Cadet Roelans, thus creating another link in the marriage
connection of the Dutch Roelans and the Northamptonshire
Littles.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; On the 18th February 1800, Charles Peter Vanderaa
married Lucy Rose.&nbsp; Witnesses to the marriage, J. Ysbrands
and James Gibbs.&nbsp; Mr. Vanderaa was Lieutenant on a
brig-of-war which was captured.&nbsp; He was received at
Peterborough on parole on 11th June 1798, and was released on
19th February 1800.&nbsp; The witness J. Ysbrands was the Captain
of the <i>Courier</i>, taken prisoner and received at
Peterborough on parole 21st June 1798, released 19th February
1800 in accordance with the Alkmaar Convention.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; After an interval of six months, on 20th August 1800,
is the entry of the marriage of Antoni Staring to Nancy
Rose.&nbsp; Witnesses, E. B. Knogz and James <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>Gibbs.&nbsp; The bridegroom was Captain on the
<i>Duyffe</i> man-of-war.&nbsp; He was received 27th May 1800,
released 26th August, having been married on the day
previous.&nbsp; The witness E. B. Knogz was surgeon on the
<i>Duyffe</i>, and was received at Peterborough and released on
the same day as the captain.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The fifth marriage of the Dutch prisoners was that of
Berthold Johannas Justin Wyeth to Sarah Wotton.&nbsp; These
marriages were all by licence and not by banns.&nbsp; In this
case the entry is &ldquo;Licence with consent of Parents,&rdquo;
but this by no means implies that the other marriages took place
without such consent; the addition of these words depended upon
the habit of the officiating minister.&nbsp; The witness was B.
Pletsz.&nbsp; Mr. Wyeth was 2nd Lieutenant of the <i>Furie</i>,
and was received on parole on 19th November 1798.&nbsp; He was
not exchanged under the Alkmaar Cartel, but remained a prisoner
until the 16th October 1801. <a name="citation208"></a><a
href="#footnote208" class="citation">[208]</a></p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>As
regards the absence of any evidence of the marriage of the French
prisoners and British women, it must be remembered that the vast
majority of the French were Roman Catholics, and that mixed
marriages of members of that Church with Protestants were
discouraged by the authorities of both Churches alike.&nbsp;
There existed also throughout these years a fierce animosity
between the French and the English, and when it is added that the
French Government did not acknowledge the legality of such
marriages, so that in many instances the unfortunate wives when
they returned with their husbands at the close of the war were
not allowed to land, we can understand that almost irresistible
pressure would be exercised to prevent these unions, and that
intimacies and flirtations which might ripen into love would very
probably be strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>One instance of an attachment between a French prisoner
confined at Norman Cross and an English girl, and their
subsequent marriage, was that of Jean Marie Philippe Habart to
Elizabeth Snow, of Stilton.&nbsp; In the prison register we find
Jean Habart entered as a sailor, captured off Calais, 20th June
1803, in <i>L&rsquo;Abondance</i>, a small vessel of ten
tons.&nbsp; He was put on board
<i>L&rsquo;Immortalit&eacute;</i>, and from her transferred to
the prison ship <i>Sandwich</i>; was sent thence to Norman Cross,
being received 27th August 1803.&nbsp; He acted as baker to Mr.
Lindsay, the contractor, and was discharged on 20th June
1811.&nbsp; This official statement differs from the family
tradition in two points only: the register says (probably
incorrectly) that he was a sailor, the family that he was only
temporarily on the boat fishing; the register says that he was
freed on 20th June 1811, his granddaughter believed that he was
freed on the emptying of the prison in 1814 (the register in this
case is doubtless correct).&nbsp; <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>His granddaughter&rsquo;s account
is, that M. Jean M. P. Habart was the son of a gunsmith in a good
position in a town on the north coast of France, and that he was
captured while fishing off the coast, and was imprisoned at
Norman Cross.&nbsp; There, as we learn from the register, not
being a combatant, but a civilian prisoner of war, he was
employed as baker to the contractor.</p>
<p>His future wife, the daughter of a farmer in Stilton, was in
the habit of bringing up the milk bought for the prisoners&rsquo;
use, and she would probably have frequent interviews with the
contractor&rsquo;s assistant, and as her granddaughter says,
&ldquo;she fell in love with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The attachment was
mutual, and when after his release he returned to France, he left
his heart behind him.&nbsp; During his imprisonment his father
had died, leaving property for his children, <a
name="citation210a"></a><a href="#footnote210a"
class="citation">[210a]</a> and Jean, when he had realised his
share, returned to England, married Miss Snow, and settled in
business, as a baker and corn merchant, in Stilton.&nbsp; The
years of his imprisonment had been sweetened by love, but his end
was a tragic one.&nbsp; On 24th January 1840, forty-three years
after he passed through the prison gates and first saw the hated
caserns and fenced courts of Norman Cross, he was killed within
sight of the fields on which they stood.</p>
<p>He was returning from a round, which he had been making to
collect money from his customers, and it is supposed that at an
inn in Peterborough he had shown his well-filled purse, and was
followed on the Norman Cross Road to the spot about three miles
from Peterborough, where he was found with his head battered in
and his pockets rifled, his empty purse being found some time
after in an adjacent field. <a name="citation210b"></a><a
href="#footnote210b" class="citation">[210b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>Such
histories as have been here given from the writer&rsquo;s long
and intimate knowledge of the locality might doubtless be
collected in the neighbourhood of other prisons, but the danger
of assuming that the mere occurrence of French names in the
neighbourhood of a depot &ldquo;still speak of the old war
time&rdquo; has already been dealt with in Chap. IV, p. 59,
footnote.</p>
<p>The parole-breakers who managed to escape, varied from the
humblest and poorest of the non-combatants, who had to pass
through many hardships and trying adventures before securing
their freedom, to men in the position and affluence of General
Lefebre, who, in May 1812, accompanied by his wife, escaped from
Cheltenham.&nbsp; He personated a German count; his wife, in
boy&rsquo;s clothes, passed for his son, and his aide-de-camp
acted as valet.&nbsp; They put up at an hotel in Jermyn Street,
got a passport, and reached Dover in style, whence they were
conveyed to the French coast.&nbsp; From France he wrote an
insolent letter to the English Government in justification of his
breach of parole.</p>
<p>A slightly different version was that he reached London as a
Russian General Officer, with two aides-de-camp, one of whom was
his wife dressed in military costume; all conversed in
German.</p>
<p>The conduct of the officers on parole both as regards the
breaking of their parole and their general orderly behaviour,
varied greatly in different districts, as also did the attitude
of the surrounding population towards the prisoners when they
attempted to escape.&nbsp; A population which for centuries had
been accustomed to receive the benefits of, and to ignore or
assist in, the trade of smuggling, would view the attempt to
escape in a different light to that in which the quiet
agricultural population of the Midlands and East Anglia would
regard it.</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>The
father of the writer, who had seen and heard much of the
prisoners of war during his boyhood in Perth, said that while the
British prisoners in France contrasted unfavourably with the
French in England, because they showed none of the skill and
industry which enabled the French to produce work, by the sale of
which they raised large sums of money, the French displayed a
moral inferiority by the frequency with which they broke their
parole, that is, disregarded the pledge given on their word of
honour.&nbsp; The following return shows that in the three years
included in the table, about one in every ten of the officers of
the army and navy who were on parole broke their pledge.&nbsp;
The proportion cannot be calculated in the case of other persons
of promiscuous occupations, as the table does not give the total
number of the prisoners of this class, but only the actual
number, 218, who broke their parole.</p>

<p>There are no records to show that the conduct of those on
parole from Norman Cross, whether they were lodged in the prison
or in the neighbouring towns and villages, was otherwise than
that of gentlemen, and the records of broken parole are very
scanty.</p>
<p>The prisoners reported themselves regularly twice a week, as
the custom was, to the agent at Peterborough, when he paid each
his allowance; they kept within bounds, and returned to their
lodgings within the prescribed hours.</p>
<p>No such amusing incident is told of any of them, as that told
of the French officer at Jedburgh, who, being an antiquarian,
soon exhausted all places of interest within the circle of one
mile radius, beyond which the country was out of bounds.&nbsp;
Being told of a most interesting building a little beyond the
first milestone from the town, he nobly struggled against the
longing to go beyond that stone, and he was rewarded for his
strict adherence to his &ldquo;Parole d&rsquo;honneur,&rdquo; for
an inspiration came to him, and, borrowing a spade and a
wheel-barrow, he laboriously dug up the milestone, and, putting
it into his wheel-barrow, carted it beyond the spot of his
heart&rsquo;s desire, and, replanting it there, revelled in his
research with unspotted honour. <a name="citation213b"></a><a
href="#footnote213b" class="citation">[213b]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Palmer, who was born in 1812, three years before Waterloo,
and lived on the North Road in a pretty farmhouse at Stibbington,
opposite the first milestone from Wansford, told the writer that
when his grandfather took the farm in 1797, the house was the
Wheat Sheaf, a coaching inn, which came to grief in 1841, killed
by the railways, the house being rechristened <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>The Road
Side Farm.&nbsp; The milestone was the outside limit for those on
parole who were quartered at Wansford (it was more than five
miles from Norman Cross), and Mr. Palmer pointed out the small
room which the prisoners used for smoking and recreation.&nbsp;
His grandmother was renowned for cooking, and could even please
the fastidious taste of the French officers.&nbsp; Mr.
Palmer&rsquo;s little baby eyes must often have looked with
wonder at the prisoners, talking in a language he could not
comprehend, and he must have gazed after them with childish
curiosity, as they turned&mdash;after a longing look into the
forbidden land beyond&mdash;to retrace their steps and reach
their lodging within the time prescribed.</p>
<p>One point should be noted, that in searching the records to
ascertain the various regiments quartered at Norman Cross, in
order to fix the date of Macgregor&rsquo;s plan, it was
incidentally found that while the West Kent Regiment was
quartered there in 1813, detachments lay at Peterborough,
Whittlesea, and other neighbouring towns; these were probably for
the purpose of acting if any difficulty arose with the prisoners
on parole.&nbsp; The punishment for breaking parole was, as
already mentioned, if the prisoner were recaptured, very
severe.&nbsp; Not only was the ration allowance reduced until all
expenses incurred in the capture were paid off, but committal to
one of the prisons or to the hulks was also inflicted.</p>
<p>The local histories of various towns where depots for
prisoners of war on parole were established have been consulted
with very disappointing results.&nbsp; There must be local
sources of information in some of the ninety-one towns enumerated
in the footnote at page 192, and any future writer on the subject
of the prisoners of war confined in Britain between
1793&ndash;1814 is advised, if he has leisure for research, to
seek information from these districts.&nbsp; The following
condensed notes on the prisoners on parole at Leek are given as
an <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>example of what took place in one of the towns where
facts have been put on record in a local history.&nbsp;
Unfortunately no such record is available for any of the towns in
the Norman Cross district.&nbsp; It was only within the last
fifty years that the following scanty information was collected
and recorded.&nbsp; Sleigh&rsquo;s <i>History of Leek</i> was
published in 1862, only forty-seven years after Waterloo, when
Mr. Neau was still alive, and when the children of the few parole
prisoners who settled in Leek when their captivity was at an end
must have been still only middle-aged people, and yet in this
first edition the prisoners are not mentioned.</p>
<p>In 1883 there were published, in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, <a
name="citation215a"></a><a href="#footnote215a"
class="citation">[215a]</a> some interesting paragraphs dealing
with the subject of the prisoners of war, and these were embodied
in the second edition of Sleigh&rsquo;s <i>Leek</i>, published in
1883. <a name="citation215b"></a><a href="#footnote215b"
class="citation">[215b]</a>&nbsp; From these paragraphs the
following condensed notes are culled.&nbsp; The officers received
all courtesy and hospitality from the principal inhabitants of
the town and neighbourhood.&nbsp; Those with good private means
used to dine out in full uniform, each with his body servant
stationed behind his chair.&nbsp; It is also stated that these
prisoners used to go out early and collect snails as a
bonne-bouche for breakfast.&nbsp; There were some men of mark
among them.&nbsp; Of these, three died during their captivity,
and were buried with many other parole prisoners in the
God&rsquo;s acre attached to the old church.&nbsp; There are
memorial stones to Joseph Dobee, Captain of <i>La Sophie</i>, ob.
2nd December 1811, &aelig;t. 54; to Chevalier J. Baptiste Mullot,
Captain of the 72nd French Regiment, ob. 9th June 1811, &aelig;t.
43; and to Charles Luneand, Captain in the French Navy, ob. 4th
March 1822.&nbsp; The latter officer must have settled in Leek,
the date of his death being seven years after Waterloo.</p>
<p>There are short notes on several others who were <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>on parole
at the Depot.&nbsp; General Brunet, captured at St. Domingo in
1803, his aide-de-camp, his adjutant, Col. Felix of the
Artillery, and Lieut. Devoust of the Navy, son of the Senator of
that name, are mentioned.&nbsp; There is a note that M. Bartin, a
French naval officer, prisoner on parole about the space of
eleven years, behaved himself extremely well all the time he
lived with us.&nbsp; John Mien, servant to General Brunet, who
was living in his eighty-fifth year in 1870, as a boy of seven
witnessed the execution of Louis XVI., and heard the drums roll
at Santerre&rsquo;s command to drown the monarch&rsquo;s
speech.</p>
<p>Several of the parole prisoners married.&nbsp; M. Salvert,
commander in the navy, married Helen Govstry of Leek Moor.&nbsp;
Jean Toufflet, a sea-captain, left issue in the town; his widow,
<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lorouds, died the 5th February 1870, &aelig;t.
84.&nbsp; M. Chouquet, a sea-captain, left a son living in
1870.&nbsp; Joseph Vattel, cook to General Brunet, married Sarah
Spilsbury.&nbsp; One, Vandome, a naval officer and a most
excellent linguist, used to render the English papers into his
native tongue for the benefit of his comrades at the
billiard-tables established by the officers.</p>
<p>That the prisoners on parole, like their fellow countrymen in
close confinement, added to their means of living by their
industry, is proved by the note in the history of Leek that there
is in existence an old card, intimating that &ldquo;James Francis
Neau, of Derby Street, sold straw hats, beautiful straw, ivory
and bone fancy articles, made by the French prisoners,&rdquo; and
many exquisite models of ships and other nick-nacks, still in
existence, testify to the facile talent and marvellously patient
industry of these prisoners.</p>
<p>This Francis Neau was a privateer officer who married a Mary
Lees; she was living in 1870.</p>
<p>There was a remarkable duel.&nbsp; A Captain Decourbes had
been fishing, and, coming in after curfew bell had <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>tolled at 8
p.m., had to report himself to Captain Grey, R.N., the
Commissary.&nbsp; He afterwards met a Captain Robert at the
billiard-room at the Black&rsquo;s Head, who grossly insulted him
and struck him in the face, so that the duel became
inevitable.&nbsp; Neau, who was present, was deputed to furnish
them with firearms; but after ransacking the town, he could only
succeed in borrowing one horse-pistol from a private in the
Yeomanry.&nbsp; The two met on Balidone Moor at three the next
morning, and tossed for the first shot.&nbsp; Decourbes won, and
hit his adversary in the breast so that the ball entered at one
side and came out at the other.&nbsp; Robert, who was previously
lame and had come on to the ground on crutches, then, grievously
wounded as he was, gathered himself up and returned the fire,
shooting Decourbes in the nape of the neck.&nbsp; Lieut. Vird of
the 72nd Regiment of Foot acted as Robert&rsquo;s second; he was
subsequently killed at Waterloo.</p>
<p>They all walked back together to Leek, the two combatants
treating their wounds very lightly; but Decourbes&rsquo; wound
went wrong, and he died of it in the course of ten days or a
fortnight.</p>
<p>The number of prisoners at Leek never exceeded 200, and they
came by detachments in 1803, 1805, 1809, and 1812, almost all
clearing out after Napoleon&rsquo;s abdication 5th April
1814.</p>
<p>It will not be forgotten that in the earlier period of the war
the prisoners on parole in various parts of the country were all
removed to Norman Cross; whether any similar change in their
condition was experienced, after the resumption of hostilities in
1803, by the prisoners out upon their parole, remains a matter of
uncertainty.</p>
<p>Passing now to the subject of the Exchange of prisoners, and
the chances that a prisoner at Norman Cross or elsewhere had of
obtaining his liberty by an exchange for an English prisoner of
equal rank, it must be borne <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>in mind that a large number of
civilians were in captivity, especially in the second period of
the war.</p>
<p>This practice of taking captive so many civilians in the
second period of the war, 1803&ndash;15, was attributed to the
British system of seizing all French vessels of every kind and
making their crews captive.&nbsp; This practice was adopted as a
retaliation for the first act of Buonaparte, then ruling France
as First Consul, when hostilities were resumed in May 1803.&nbsp;
As a reprisal for what he considered the dishonourable action of
two British frigates in seizing in harbour French merchantmen
before the formal declaration of war had reached France, the
Consul ordered the immediate arrest of every British subject
between the age of eighteen and sixty who happened to be in
France at that time, thus throwing 10,000 peaceable travellers
and others into captivity.</p>
<p>Wellington, replying 4th September 1813 to an application from
Mr. J. S. Larpent requesting the General to obtain his release
from captivity, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In this war, which on account of the
violence of animosity with which it is conducted, it is to be
hoped will be the last, for some time at least, everybody taken
is considered a prisoner of war, and none are released without
exchange.&nbsp; There are several persons, now in <i>my</i>
power, in the same situation as yourself in that respect, that is
to say, non-combatants according to the known and anciently
practised rules of war; among others there is the secretary of
the Governor of San Sebastian. . . .&rdquo; <a
name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218"
class="citation">[218]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such being the spirit of the war, negotiations for exchange
continually fell through.</p>
<p>In the early period it was the want of good faith on the part
of the French, and the unfairness with which the exchange was
conducted by them, that on more than one occasion put a stop to
the general exchange <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>which was going on.&nbsp; Thus in
1798, when a general exchange had been arranged, and the Depot at
Norman Cross was rapidly emptying, the <i>Samaritan</i> cartel
took 201 French prisoners to France, but returned with only 71
British.&nbsp; The <i>Britannia</i> carried over 150, and 450
were conveyed by two other cartels; the three returned without a
single British prisoner.&nbsp; The captains of the vessels were
told that there were no British prisoners to return, and they
were ordered to sea at once, regardless of wind or weather.</p>
<p>During the early negotiations a return was furnished to show
what had been the result of the general exchange up to the date
when fresh arrangements were to be made, and it appeared that
6,056 British prisoners had been received from France, while she
had received from the British 16,334, including 4,986 captured at
Martinique and Guadeloupe.&nbsp; On 19th March 1798 by the fresh
exchange France had received 12,543, Britain only 5,045, leaving
a balance of 7,498 due to England.&nbsp; The earliest prisoners
to be exchanged from Norman Cross left on 24th August 1797, only
four months after the first prisoners had been received
there.&nbsp; The contingent was sent to Lynn; it numbered 305,
and consisted of 7 captains of privateers, 4 sergeants, 6
corporals, 148 soldiers, 127 seamen and 7 boys, and 6 not
specified.&nbsp; They sailed in the <i>Rosine</i>, which had
brought the same number of British to England.</p>
<p>The article of the agreement providing that the prisoners for
exchange were not to be selected, but were to be taken according
to the priority of their capture, was afterwards modified, so as
to select the aged, the infirm, such as were not seamen, and boys
under twelve years of age!&nbsp; Amid all the bickering and
obstinacy on both sides in the negotiations as to the treatment
and exchange of the prisoners, there is one instance which shows
that the chivalrous spirit of the French was not dead.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>In
March 1797 M. Charretie, the French Commissary in England,
enclosed a list of thirty-six British seamen to be released
without exchange for their humanity in rescuing and aiding the
crew of a French vessel bearing the appropriate name of <i>Les
Droits de l&rsquo;Homme</i>.</p>
<p>Although it was a traffic strictly forbidden, some of the
prisoners sold their turn of exchange to their more wealthy
comrades, the purchaser assuming the name of the vendor, and vice
versa.&nbsp; If detected, the vendor forfeited his rights of
exchange, and was kept a prisoner until the end of the war.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding this regulation, it was said that one man had
contrived to carry on these transactions from 1797 to 13th
January 1800 without detection.&nbsp; This voluntary prolongation
of the imprisonment surely helps to prove the falsity of the
statements of the French as to the treatment of the prisoners by
the British.</p>
<p>This practice of personating a fellow prisoner was carried out
occasionally under more tragic conditions.</p>
<p>In the course of the investigations to establish the facts of
the epidemic of 1800&ndash;01, a certificate was found with the
name Fran&ccedil;ois le Fevre crossed out, and the name of
Bernard Batrille substituted, with a note that the name of
Fran&ccedil;ois le Fevre was assumed by Batrille when he entered
the hospital to die of consumption.&nbsp; This was, doubtless,
not the sole instance of such practices among the
prisoners.&nbsp; A prisoner high up in the list for exchange, who
knew that he was dying, would, when about to enter the hospital,
for a sum of money or from friendship, exchange his current
number and his name with another man low down in the list, the
dying man, if this was done for payment, thus securing a sum of
money for his heirs in France, and the other increasing his
chance of release by exchange.</p>
<p>The case of Le Fevre and Batrille would have escaped
detection, but for the special investigation made by Captain
Woodriff to establish the identity of those <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>who had
died in the epidemic unrecognised.&nbsp; The investigation led to
the identification among the living prisoners of Fran&ccedil;ois
le Fevre, who had been personating Batrille, since he entered the
hospital, and had died, and was buried in the name of the former
man.</p>
<p>During the first period of the war, 1793&ndash;1802, exchange
went on, with interruptions from the causes mentioned.&nbsp; The
prisoners passed in a sluggish stream through Norman Cross, but
so sluggish that many of them were there, confined or out on
parole, during the whole five years.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the
exchange the prisons were at times greatly overcrowded, and in
1801, when the French army in Egypt surrendered to Abercrombie,
such was the burden of prisoners that no attempt was made to
claim the troops as captives, but they were transported in
British ships to France.</p>
<p>During the second period of the war negotiations for exchange
completely failed.&nbsp; In April 1810, when there were about
10,000 British prisoners in France, and 50,000 French in Britain,
Mr. Mackenzie was sent by the British Ministry to treat for a
general exchange, the main condition in the British proposal
being that for every French prisoner returned to France, a
British prisoner of equal rank should be returned to Britain;
that this should go on until the whole of the British prisoners
were restored; and after that was accomplished, the British
Government would continue the restoration of the French, on the
understanding that France on her part returned to his native
country, man for man, one of the prisoners of Britain&rsquo;s
allies&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a Spanish or Portuguese of equal rank
with the French prisoner handed over by Britain.</p>
<p>To this the French Emperor would not agree; he insisted that
the British and their allies should be reckoned as one army, and
that for four Frenchmen released from the British prisons and
returned to France, only one British subject should be returned
to England, <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>and three other prisoners of various nationalities
restored to their respective Governments.&nbsp; On this plan, if
the negotiations fell through while the exchange was going on,
say, when it was half way through, France would have got back
from Britain 20,000 of her veterans, England would have received
only 5,000 Britons, the balance, 15,000, being a rabble of
Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian levies of practically no value,
and this contention Buonaparte held to, although it was his
opinion expressed a few years later &ldquo;that while as a
fighting unit, you might set against <i>one</i> Frenchman
<i>one</i> Englishman, you would require <i>two</i> Prussian,
Dutch, or soldiers of the Confederation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buonaparte, referring to the failure of these negotiations,
accounted for his firmness by his want of faith in the British,
and his conviction that when they got their 10,000 countrymen
back, they would find some excuse to stop the further
exchange.&nbsp; Could we, on our part, after the unfair conduct
of the exchanges, in the early part of the war, instances of
which with the Norman Cross prisoners have been given, rely on
the French Government carrying out in good faith even its own
scheme, which on the face of it showed a disregard of British
rights. <a name="citation222"></a><a href="#footnote222"
class="citation">[222]</a>&nbsp; The negotiations fell through,
and the great bulk of the prisoners at Norman Cross had to drag
out their weary life until the abdication of Buonaparte and his
retirement to Elba in 1814.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been necessary in the
preceding chapters to allude occasionally to the English
prisoners in France, and a short chapter on their experiences may
be deemed not irrelevant to the scheme of this little
history.&nbsp; The author having in his boyhood been personally
acquainted with the Rev. John Hopkinson, Rector of Alwalton, near
Peterborough, who had been, from February 1804 to April 1814, a
prisoner of war in France, will avail himself of the kind
permission of this gentleman&rsquo;s son, the Rev. W. Hopkinson,
J.P., of Sutton Grange, Northamptonshire, and commence the
chapter with a narrative of his experiences which Mr. J.
Hopkinson had himself written, and which was found among his
papers after his death in 1853.</p>
<p>The prison at Verdun, where Mr. Hopkinson was confined at
times closely, at others on parole, was occupied by the subjects
of Great Britain and her allies, the British being the great
majority.&nbsp; The prisoners were of the same class as those who
were allowed on parole <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>in Britain and who were distributed
either in special prisons such as Norman Cross or in parties,
which might vary from a few units to 300 or more, in one of the
towns enumerated in the footnote, Chapter X, p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page192">192</a></span>.</p>
<p>Mr. Hopkinson was the son of the vicar of Morton, near Bourne
in Lincolnshire.&nbsp; He was born in 1782 within three miles of
the home of Hereward the Wake, and early in life he showed that
he was endowed with some of that hero&rsquo;s spirit&mdash;a
spirit too adventurous for the quiet parsonage.&nbsp; After
various experiences, commencing with his following as a child a
recruiting party, and joining it as a drummer boy, he entered His
Majesty&rsquo;s service on the 5th March 1803 as a cadet
(first-class volunteer) on board the frigate <i>Hussar</i>.&nbsp;
This vessel, after some brushes with the enemy while cruising in
the Mediterranean, was wrecked off the Isle of Saints on the
Coast of France.&nbsp; Mr. Hopkinson&rsquo;s experiences in this
misfortune and up to the date of his entering Verdun are given in
his own words, while a brief biography added by his widow brings
the narrative up to the date of his release after the first
abdication of Buonaparte, and his arrival in England in April
1814, simultaneously with the evacuation of Norman Cross to be
described in the next chapter.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Monday night, February 6th, 1804, weighed
from Ares Bay near Ferrol, bound to England with despatches, made
sail and worked out of Ferrol Bay.&nbsp; Tuesday, Fresh breezes
for the best part of the day from the Rd.&nbsp; Wednesday the
8th&mdash;At noon by account Ushant bore from us N. 24 Lat:
distant 109 miles, towards the Evening the breeze died away and
became variable, but sprung up from the Southward and Westward at
6 o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At 8 o&rsquo;clock P.M. Ushant distant 50
miles, went on deck to keep my watch, the ship steering N.E. by
E. by the Captain&rsquo;s orders, who had also left orders to be
called at 12 o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The breeze continued,
freshening considerably till 10 o&rsquo;clock, when I was obliged
to leave the deck to attend the Gunner in transporting <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>powder,
which duty we were on the point of finishing at 11.30, when the
ship struck with great violence, put the lights out immediately
and got on deck as soon as possible, where we found every person
struck with terror, it being the general opinion, that the
violent shock which they had felt proceeded from the powder
magazine and expecting every moment to be their last; but when
relieved from this dreadful impression by our appearing on deck,
they immediately let go the small bower anchor and proceeded to
take in sail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears that at the time the ship struck she was
going between 8 and 9 knots, which hurried her on the rocks with
such violence, that the tiller was carried away, the rudder
unhung from the stern post, and a great hole made somewhere under
the starboard bow, and after beating over the reef, the ship was
running on an immense rock, which was prevented by the letting go
of the anchor.&nbsp; As soon as the sails were furled we manned
the pumps, and found the ship made at the rate of 15 feet water
per hour.&nbsp; At 12, on the turning of the tide, the ship
tailed on the rocks and struck with dreadful violence at times:
let go the best bower anchor, scuttled the spirit room bulkhead
to clear the water from aft.&nbsp; Fired minute guns and rockets
at times, with the signal of distress: discovered a light on our
starboard beam, a small island, but no one on board knew for a
certainty where we were, employed all night at the pumps, and
clearing away booms to get spars out to shore the ship up, as
also to be in readiness to get the boats out if requisite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At 6 a.m. daylight discovered to us our situation, that
we were upon a reef of rocks, extending from the island of Saints
Westward in to the Atlantic, &lsquo;<i>Hinc atque hinc
vast&oelig; rupes</i>&rsquo; at a distance of half a mile from
the island.&nbsp; Got the shores out on the starboard side,
lowered the cutter, and sent the master to sound for a passage
among the innumerable rocks with which we <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>were
perfectly surrounded.&nbsp; At 7 the ship had gained one foot on
the pumps, and during the last hour had 3 ft. 8 inches water in
the hold, at 8 the master returned, and had only found a narrow
passage with 10 feet water in the deepest part, which report
together with every appearance of an approaching gale from the
S.W. confirmed the opinion already formed, that we were precluded
from every means of saving the ship.&nbsp; In consequence of
which Capt. W. ordered the third division of seamen, and all the
marines to land, and take possession of the island, in order to
secure a retreat, and, if possible, the means of escape from the
enemy.&nbsp; Got the boats out and landed the force above
mentioned, being given to understand by the Gunner, who pretended
to know the place, that it was a Military Station, and
consequently, that we should meet with some resistance; but on
arriving at the town found it only occupied by a few
fishermen.&nbsp; Took possession of the church and made use of it
as barracks for our ship&rsquo;s company, whom we were occupied
landing all the remaining part of the day, the current running
with such rapidity between the rocks, that it was with the
greatest difficulty and danger the boats could go to and
fro.&nbsp; This was however happily effected without any
accident; landed also three days&rsquo; provisions: &lsquo;<i>Tum
celerem corruptam undis cerealiaque arma
expediunt</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind all this day very boisterous from the S.W.
with heavy rain, and every symptom of an approaching gale.&nbsp;
Towards dusk, mustered the ship&rsquo;s company, put them all
into the Church and placed sentries over them, patrol&rsquo;d the
island all night, employed all the forenoon in burning the
remnants of the ship, and fitting 13 sail of fishing boats,
besides our Captain&rsquo;s barge for our departure for England:
the Captain&rsquo;s boat distinguished by the Union Jack being
destined to lead the way, and the other boats being formed into
three divisions, commanded by the three Lieuts. with
distinguishing <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>names to follow in due order, the wind being fresh from
the S.W.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may now begin to speak on a smaller scale, and only
mention the proceedings of our own boat, with occasional remarks
concerning the others.&nbsp; At noon, made sail from the Island,
scudding under a fore and main sail alternately.&nbsp; At 4,
finding the wind heading us fast, hauled on a wind to endeavour
to keep off shore as much as possible, in order to get on the
Beniquet if necessary, most of the other boats being in sight,
the Captain&rsquo;s just perceptible ahead.&nbsp; At 6, strong
gales and squally, with rain and a tremendous heavy sea.&nbsp;
Observed the Hay stacks on our lee beam: at 6.30, observed the
oars and rowlock of the Captain&rsquo;s barge floating to leeward
which made us fear, &lsquo;<i>fraguntur remi</i>,&rsquo; that he
had perished.&nbsp; At 7, passed to leeward of the Parquet, which
was very perceptible by the roaring and breaking of the sea,
which was awful in the extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At 9, finding we could not weather St. Matthew&rsquo;s,
Mr. B. and the commanding Officer, &lsquo;<i>O socii passi
graviora</i>,&rsquo; of the boat addressed the crew, to consult
concerning the best means of saving their lives, when it was
unanimously decided to bear up for Brest, a dire, but unavoidable
alternative.&nbsp; Employed continually pumping and baling the
boat, over which the seas were continually breaking.&nbsp; At
10.30, spoke one of our boats, which was laying broadside to the
seas dismasted, but could not give her any assistance.&nbsp; At
11 were hailed by the batteries, did not answer, but hauled close
to the land; they fired at us several times, but without
effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At 11.30 ran alongside a line of Battle ship which
caused an immediate uproar on board of her.&nbsp; They threw us a
rope, but no one could hold it, on account of the cold and numbed
state of all on board.&nbsp; The ship (which proved to be the
<i>Foudroyant</i>) immediately manned her boat, and boarded us,
and when the Officer <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>understood who we were, he took us
out of our boat, which he left moored to a buoy, and put us on
board of <i>L&rsquo;Indienne</i> frigate, the tide running too
strong to regain his own ship.&nbsp; We were uncommonly well
treated on board, one of the Mids made me change my clothes, and
they gave us every refreshment in their power, after which I fell
asleep till 3 a.m., when I was called to go on board the
<i>Foudroyant</i>, the ship to which we had first
surrendered.&nbsp; Here the Captain behaved to us in a handsomer
way than we had any right to expect, giving up his own cabin for
our use, furnishing us with linen, and every delicacy he had to
offer.&nbsp; Got up at 6 and walked the deck with the French
midshipmen, who gave me to understand that our countrymen had
been coming in the harbour at all hours of the night, and they
also told me that our boat had gone to the bottom.&nbsp; After
breakfast with the Capt. he expressed the greatest concern at
being obliged to send us on board the Flagship.&nbsp; We
accordingly at 10 o&rsquo;clock left him, impressed with the
highest sense of his humanity and generosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On our arrival on board the Flagship we had the
inexpressible pleasure of meeting with a great many of our
shipmates, of whose fate till then we were totally
ignorant.&nbsp; After dining on board, we were all ordered on
shore to be confined in the hospital, until the will of the
Minister of War should be known.&nbsp; When in the Hospital we
were mustered and found that the following were missing, Capt. W.
and his crew making altogether 12, whom some seamen affirmed to
have seen sink, which statement was partly corroborated by our
having seen his oars.&nbsp; Mr. Gordon, midshipman and his crew,
15 in number, who, when last seen, were a long way to windward,
and Mr. Thomas the E<sup>n</sup>. who was drowned in
landing.&nbsp; The next day to our great astonishment Mr. Gordon
and his crew joined us and gave us slight reasons to hope that
Capt. W. had reached the Beniquet.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;During the next week we were visited by the
Commissary of War, who told us that the Minister of War had given
orders for our being removed to Verdun, and advised us to prepare
as much as possible for our march to that place; he also had the
goodness to send us a banker who gave money for bills on the
Government, a thing that was very acceptable, as by the length of
time we had been at sea all our Lieuts. had some pay due, and
they supplied the Midshipmen with small sums, which, added to the
allowance of the French, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>per diem</i>,
might enable us to travel very comfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 17th we were told to hold ourselves in readiness
to march the next morning at daylight.&nbsp; We consequently were
drawn up in the hospital yard the next morning to the number of
264&mdash;21 of whom were officers, the rest seamen.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Unus absit.</i>&rsquo;&nbsp; We left Brest at 7 a.m.
escorted by a strong guard of infantry and about twenty
horsemen.&nbsp; The morning was fine and pleasant.&nbsp; After
marching about two hours we came to the summit of a hill, whence
we had a fine view of Brest harbour and roads, with the adjacent
coast, bounded by the Atlantic, on which, at about the distance
of 15 miles, we could plainly see our whole Channel Fleet
standing in, under easy sail&mdash;this sight, mortifying as it
was, became still more so, by the jeerings of the French
Soldiery, which, to his credit be it spoken, were repressed as
much as possible by the Officer who conducted us.&nbsp; About 1
p.m. reached Landernau, a small town, distant from Brest about 5
leagues.&nbsp; We went on in this way till the 24th, when our
escort was relieved by another of a similar <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>kind at St.
Brieux, a small seaport town.&nbsp; The officer on leaving us,
requested us to give him a paper testifying his good treatment of
us, to which we readily assented, his behaviour to us having been
uniformly kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To repeat every day&rsquo;s march would be useless,
suffice it to say, that after passing thro&rsquo; Rennes,
Alen&ccedil;on, Versailles, St. Cloud, St. Denis, within a mile
of Paris, and divers other places of less note, we arrived at
Verdun on Sunday, March 25th, having marched a distance of 204
leagues.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hopkinson, when liberated; did not continue in the
service, but went to Clare College, was ordained, became
Precentor of Peterborough Cathedral, and later Rector of Alwalton
(about three miles from Norman Cross), where he died in
1853.&nbsp; The following note was added to the prisoner&rsquo;s
own account by his widow:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And here with this interesting account of
his shipwreck and the consequent imprisonment of himself and
shipmates, the narrative ceases, and all that can be told of the
eleven years&rsquo; captivity must be imperfect.&nbsp; But, young
and full of energy, after the first trial it was a time of mixed
pain and pleasure.&nbsp; From the age of fifteen to twenty-five
is not often the period of despondency.&nbsp; He formed during
this time friendships and attachments which only ceased with
life: and be it observed the circle which was bound together so
closely, was composed entirely of those of honour and
principle.&nbsp; While there were unfortunately very many who by
their conduct were a disgrace to their country, this small knot
of friends to whom he belonged, who shared each other&rsquo;s
purse and each other&rsquo;s poverty, left in France a reputation
unsullied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many years after when he visited, under such different
circumstances, these scenes of his youth with his brother, he was
received everywhere with a warmth <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>of affection and respect affecting
to witness.&nbsp; The friendships formed at this period under
mutual hardships and privations were very lasting and peculiar;
each saw the other without disguise and selfishness&mdash;that
bane of worldly friendship could not exist, where all had the
same privations.&nbsp; He would tell of times, when penniless, he
positively was without food, and the means of procuring it, till
he and his friend, both good fishermen, procured a meal by
fishing in the Meuse.&nbsp; Many were the anecdotes they would
relate when meeting under what seemed happier
circumstances.&nbsp; There were times when they heard nothing of
home or England for a length of time.&nbsp; On one occasion on
the arrival of fresh prisoners, one of them unloosing his cravat,
let fall a piece of newspaper, which he had wrapped in it to
stiffen it; how anxiously was it snatched up by those poor
captives.&nbsp; In this piece of waste paper he read of some
promotion to his brother in his profession when only to know that
he lived was joy unspeakable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always spoke well of the French in general: it is
true and must have been mortifying, they were on some occasions
led out to be gazed at by the populace, as kind of trophies, and
when Nelson died, their grief was embittered by the jeerings of
the vulgar, &lsquo;Votre Nelson est mort&rsquo;&mdash;such is the
fate of prisoners of war&mdash;but as a body he always said they
were a kind people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the return of peace in 1814, hailed and welcomed as
it was in every quarter of the globe, what must have been the joy
of him, who had passed inactive wearisome years separated from
his native land!&nbsp; The long march homeward was never
wearisome.&nbsp; Arrived in London, he repaired to the Hotel,
where his brother was expecting him.&nbsp; He had just stepped
out.&nbsp; Anxious and excited my husband went out too, hoping to
find him: in the meantime his brother returned, and being told of
his arrival, awaited him on the step of the door.&nbsp; When he
<a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>came
back, the foreign look and dress at once assured his brother that
it was himself, and he stood in his way.&nbsp; Impatient at an
impediment to entering the house, he hastily begged him to step
aside, when the words, &lsquo;John, do you not know me?&rsquo;
told him he had found his brother.&nbsp; Both were so changed
that they should not have known each other.&nbsp; How often, and
with ever new delight, did he recall this meeting!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He returned home, and tho&rsquo; much, very much had
happened to cloud his happiness, the feeling of liberty so long
unknown, was in his heart!&nbsp; He brought home, not only from
his own superior Officers, but also from those of the French,
testimonials of good conduct, having most rigidly preserved his
parole, tho&rsquo; with a fair chance of escape often urged to
break it, and having suffered by close imprisonment for the
breach of it in others.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hopkinson, during his imprisonment at Verdun, kept a
register of his fellow prisoners, and in his later years he
filled in as far as he could the after history of his prison
comrades.&nbsp; This, being probably a unique document, is, by
the kind permission of his son Mr. W. Hopkinson, reproduced in
the appendix. <a name="citation232"></a><a href="#footnote232"
class="citation">[232]</a>&nbsp; From this register it will be
seen it was not only the French prisoners at Leek and elsewhere
who fought duels.&nbsp; Four deaths from fatal wounds received in
these affairs of honour are recorded.&nbsp; The duel, one hundred
years ago, was the customary and generally acknowledged method of
settling questions of honour, libels, etc., which are now in this
country settled in the law courts.&nbsp; As Mrs. Hopkinson says
in her note, the naval cadet never broke his parole, but on three
occasions when held captive, not by his word of honour, but by
bars and bolts, his respect for these did not prevent his
attempting to escape; for the first attempt he was confined in a
cell for <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>one month, for his second attempt two months, and for
his third, three.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight years after the termination of the war, Mr.
Hopkinson thought he would take his son to Verdun, to the spot
where he, the lad&rsquo;s father, had spent ten years of what
should have been the best period of his life.&nbsp; He found the
chamber in which he had been confined unaltered, and utilised as
a barrack room.&nbsp; Examining a bar in one of the windows, he
showed his son a cut three parts through it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Mr. Hopkinson, &ldquo;was
made by me and some comrades with a file made from a watch-spring
more than forty years ago, when we were on the eve of an attempt
to escape.&nbsp; We had almost finished cutting the bar, and a
little midshipman was in the act of coiling the rope which one of
our party had managed to secure from the well in the barrack
yard, when the tread of the guard was heard coming to our room;
the poor little midshipman dropped it, making sure that he would
be killed.&nbsp; The steps came nearer, and another of the party,
quick as lightning and with the skill of a seaman, coiled it in
the high earthen pitcher-shaped jar, in which was our supply of
water.&nbsp; Hardly had he finished, when the guard entered and
looked round, for the rope had been missed; they searched in the
bedding, but not in the jar, and we escaped detection.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sketch of a young naval cadet&rsquo;s experiences at
Verdun represents, no doubt, fairly faithfully what was going on
at Norman Cross, and in many another part of England, in those
days of the terrible war. <a name="citation233"></a><a

<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>Before quitting Verdun, we may mention that it was not
the only town where English prisoners were confined.&nbsp; They
were also at Amiens, Auxonne, Dunkirk, Saumur, Tangiers, Tours,
Vitr&eacute;, Givet, Saarlouis, and other places.</p>
<p>For those guilty of misconduct, breach of parole, or attempts
at escape, the subterranean dungeons at the Fortress of Bitche
were reserved.&nbsp; If the accounts of the lives of French
prisoners in England are scanty, those of the British in France
are meagre in the extreme, being confined principally to short
notices of the <i>d&eacute;tenus</i> in Verdun, generally
well-to-do people, and naval and military officers, who were
fairly well treated.&nbsp; As to the prisoners in general we
read:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The distress under which the British seamen
suffered in France was excessive.&nbsp; The scanty pittance
allowed each man daily consisted of a small square piece of
bullock&rsquo;s liver, a slice of black bread, and a glass of new
brandy.&nbsp; Had it not been for the relief they received from
the Patriotic Fund, forwarded to them through a private channel,
many of them must have perished from want.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The object of the French, in treating our seamen with
such inhumanity in this respect, was to make them dissatisfied
with their own Government, by inducing a belief that they were
neglected by it, and thus to tempt them to enter the French
service.&nbsp; Numerous were the offers made to them for that
purpose, which, to the honour of our brave but unfortunate tars,
were usually rejected with contempt and indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They resolved to perish, rather than prove traitors to
their country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following extract from a letter from Lieutenant <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Tucker, who
was captured with Captain Woodriff, gives a brief and good
description of the life of a prisoner of his position:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lieutenants were allowed 56 francs a month
from the French Government, which just paid their lodging.&nbsp;
No cause to complain of indulgence, allowed to walk or ride 6
miles in every direction, provided they were in before the
shutting of the town gates at 9 o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp;
Captains were obliged to sign their names every 5 days,
Lieutenants once a day, all other prisoners twice a day.&nbsp; No
other restrictions, could lodge where they pleased, and as they
liked.&nbsp; There was a first class of society, very good, but
very extravagant; they are chiefly people of fortune, who were
detained when travelling at the commencement of the war.&nbsp;
The senior naval English officer was Captain Gower, late of the
<i>Shannon</i>, then Captain Woodriff and 5 others, besides 38
Lieutenants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were 2 clubs, where there were all the French,
and sometimes the English newspapers: in short, if a prisoner has
health, he may spend his time pleasantly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no society between the English and French; the
latter are a few Military, and tradesmen, who had made their
fortunes by the extravagance of Englishmen since the
war.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fairly reliable picture of the life at Verdun may be
gathered from a comedy in two acts, called <i>The Prisoner of
War</i>, by Douglas Jerrold, produced at Drury Lane in 1812; the
scene of the play is laid at Verdun.&nbsp; Making allowance for
dramatic licence, the situations are probably fairly accurately
described from the recollection of people known to the
author.&nbsp; There is the competition among landlords for
prisoner lodgers, there is the Jew money-lender who fattens on <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>them, there
are the breaches of regulations, the escapes and punishments at
the Fortress of Bitche, the latter corresponding to the hulks at
Chatham for delinquents in England.</p>
<p>From various detached sources we obtain other fragmentary
glances of Verdun, and learn that only British were confined
there, the Austrians and Prussians being at Chalons.&nbsp; As
late as 1805 ordinary sailors were also confined there, as it is
recorded that a party managed to escape to England in May of that
year.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the same year a party of 150 were
removed from Verdun to Valenciennes.&nbsp; &ldquo;The march took
eight days.&nbsp; The <i>real gentlemen</i> were allowed on
parole; the <i>n&eacute;gociants</i>, or merchants, were
confined.&rdquo;&nbsp; The best account is from the portfolio of
a <i>d&eacute;tenu</i>, published in 1810.&nbsp; One quotation
must suffice:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The number of prisoners of war at Verdun
has generally amounted to 400, consisting chiefly of naval
officers and masters of merchant-ships, and including a few
officers of the Army, who had been shipwrecked on the French
coast, and some passengers who had been taken on their voyage
from the East Indies.&nbsp; Add to these some common seamen, who,
instead of being sent to Givet or Saarlouis, the usual depots for
sailors, were permitted to remain at Verdun at the intercession
of any persons of respectability who would take them into their
service.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is another brief account by James Forbes, a member of
the Society of Antiquaries, who was detained for some
months.&nbsp; Beyond the fact that he was a prisoner in the town,
and had to answer the daily roll-call, his lot was not a hard
one.&nbsp; By the interest of Sir Joseph Banks, the &ldquo;Savant
Anglais&rdquo; was released.</p>
<p><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>His
book is valuable as giving the text of the release forms,
etc.&nbsp; As throwing light on the lot of the rank and file of
the army and the ordinary seamen, information has been culled
from the article, &ldquo;Prisoners of War,&rdquo; published in
<i>Chambers&rsquo; Journal</i>, 1854.&nbsp; This article deals
shortly with the treatment and conduct of the British prisoners
in France.&nbsp; The writer says that on the long march into the
interior they were often treated cruelly and harshly,
occasionally handcuffed; they were escorted by soldiers of the
line, the character of their treatment depending, naturally,
greatly upon the officer in command.&nbsp; This writer confirms
the dietary mentioned already.&nbsp; The prisoners were paid by
the French Government a sou and a half (not quite three
farthings) a day; this was supplemented by a penny a day from a
fund raised by public subscription in England, the masters and
mates of merchantmen participating in this small but welcome
addition to their subsistence.&nbsp; In accordance with the
directions of Othello quoted on our title page, we must quote
from the article the remarks on the conduct of our countrymen in
captivity.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Brandy and spirits being cheap, the
Britishers often got intoxicated and gave endless troubles to the
incensed officials.&nbsp; Their conduct was that of the
proverbial, reckless British seaman.&nbsp; They did no work, but
spent their time in playing rough games of every description,
singing, speechifying, fighting, drinking, and taunting and
defying the French, Frog-eating Mounseers, all and sundry, who,
by the way, often made them rue their rough pranks.&nbsp;
Insubordination was commonly punished by separate confinement
with bread and water, and worst of all, and unendurable to
English Jack, a total deprivation of tobacco. . . .&nbsp; Any
personal assault on the soldiers or the gendarmes was a most
serious offence, the punishment of death being assigned to the
striking <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>a gendarme.&nbsp; In some instances this terrible and
outrageous penalty was actually carried into effect.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be in the recollection of the reader that the British
Government provided the clothing of their subjects who were
captives in a foreign prison of war.&nbsp; The dress is described
by the author of the article in <i>Chambers&rsquo; Journal</i> as
a gray jacket and trousers and a straw hat; it contrasted
favourably with the suit of many colours in which our Government
clad their French prisoners.</p>
<p>In the paragraphs in which the article deals with the British
prisoners in Denmark, the anonymous writer shows a sympathy with
Denmark which may account for the severe language in which he
deals with the British prisoners in that country.&nbsp; In
describing their gambling propensities and consequent moral
depravity he uses almost the actual words used by Captain
Woodriff and others when they described Les Mis&eacute;rables and
their class in the English prisons.</p>
<p>Possibly some future searcher in the bypaths of history may
take up the subject of British prisoners of war in the countries
of their captors, and we may hope that the result of his
researches will form a picture of our countrymen more agreeable
to the British eye than that depicted by the writer in
<i>Chambers&rsquo; Journal</i>. <a name="citation238"></a><a

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> what feverish anxiety must the
occupants of the courts and caserns of Norman Cross have listened
to the garbled accounts of the progress of the war which reached
their ears towards the close of the eighteenth and the dawn of
the nineteenth centuries.&nbsp; How their hopes must have been
raised when they heard of the defeat of the Austrians by Moreau
at Hohenlinden, of the sudden crossing of the Alps by their hero
Buonaparte, his swoop on to another Austrian army and its defeat
at Marengo.&nbsp; When they learned that in 1800 Austria had
signed a Treaty of Peace with France (The Treaty of
Lun&eacute;ville, Feb. 1801) and that England was left to fight
single-handed, they must have thought delivery extremely
near.&nbsp; To cheer them further would come the news of the
alliance of Russia, Denmark, Sweden, and Prussia to constitute
&ldquo;the armed neutrality,&rdquo; which though not actually at
war with Great Britain, was formed to check her progress and
paralyse her navy.&nbsp; The time when the French Army would have
England under its foot and the prison doors would be thrown open
must be close at hand.</p>
<p>Then would come to discourage them, and to dash <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>their happy
anticipations to the ground, the news of Abercrombie&rsquo;s
victory at Alexandria, and the defeat and surrender of the French
Army of Egypt in March of the same year.&nbsp; This would be
followed rapidly by the report that Nelson had in April attacked
the Danish Fleet at Copenhagen, destroying or capturing the
greater part of it, and thus breaking up the Armed Neutrality. <a
name="citation240"></a><a href="#footnote240"
class="citation">[240]</a>&nbsp; The more astute of the prisoners
may have seen that a pause in the hostilities must come, but
after five years&rsquo; confinement within a fence enclosing two
and a half acres of ground, despair must have prevailed and
almost drowned hope.&nbsp; France&rsquo;s prospect of defeating
Britain in the Mediterranean was slight, and on the other hand
England, having taken almost all the French colonies, and being
compelled to hold them, although supreme on the sea, had no army
with which to attack France itself.&nbsp; Even though the news
reached Norman Cross that in October 1801 the preliminaries of a
treaty of peace had been signed, the prisoners could feel no
certainty that these would come through the troublesome
negotiations which must follow, and that peace would actually be
concluded.</p>
<p>Therefore when at length the Treaty of Peace was signed at
Amiens in Picardy on 27th March 1802, and the news reached the
captives, it was received with frantic demonstrations of
joy.&nbsp; The great uncertain terror had gone; captivity was at
an end; France, Holland, Spain, with parents, wives, children,
sweethearts, and all they loved, were in sight.&nbsp; At once
preparations for departure were made: the prisoners forced the
sale of their manufactures, they drew out <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>their
money, and got together their various belongings ready to leave
at the first chance.&nbsp; The prisoners&rsquo; joy was
unbounded, and left no room for a disturbing thought or feeling;
but great as was the sense of relief to the British nation at
large, there was much dissatisfaction as to the terms of the
Treaty, and naturally the storekeepers and prison officials,
suddenly thrown out of employment, had a dash of bitterness in
their cup.</p>

<p>After Amiens the Government took instant steps to relieve the
country of the expense and responsibility of the prisoners, the
object being to get the prison empty and the establishment closed
at the first possible moment.&nbsp; Immediately after the
signature of peace, cartels to carry 2,600 prisoners were
chartered at Norman Cross.&nbsp; The Admiralty allowed
15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per man as payment for conveying the
prisoners to France.&nbsp; A facsimile of the order to Captain
Holditch, Master of the <i>Argo</i>, is, by the kind permission
of his grandson, Mr. Share of Truro, here reproduced, and it will
be seen that it is dated only twelve days later than the Treaty
of Peace. <a name="citation241"></a><a href="#footnote241"
class="citation">[241]</a></p>
<p>The number of captives at Norman Cross was at that time very
low, about half the number of those confined at the time of the
second clearance, twelve years later.&nbsp; They left in four
detachments, the first 1,000 strong, the second 1,040, the third
600, the last 100.&nbsp; <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>With what joy did they take that
journey, cheered on their way by the good wishes of the country
folk, even if they did shout &ldquo;Good-bye,
Froggies!&rdquo;&nbsp; This return of 3,100, as the number of
those confined at Norman Cross on 27th March 1802, indicates the
difference in the matter of exchange during the first period of
the war, 1793&ndash;1802, and the second, 1803&ndash;14.&nbsp; In
this second period there was no steady outflow from the prisons
to keep down the numbers, and they were ever filling with the
captives sent in by Wellington and others.</p>
<p>On 29th April 1802 the prison was emptied, and although the
Government had not sufficient confidence in the permanence of the
peace entirely to dismantle the Depot, it was ordered that while
all stoves, ranges, and grates, with the large iron boilers, were
to remain until further orders, the copper boilers were to be
sold, lamps and lamp irons were to be securely locked up, the
furniture to be delivered to the barrack master, the hammocks to
be sold at 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> each, the coverlets at the best
price obtainable, and as the barrack master refused to take the
soil carts, these also were to be disposed of for what they would
fetch. <a name="citation242"></a><a href="#footnote242"
class="citation">[242]</a>&nbsp; All books, letters, papers,
etc., were to be sent to the Transport Office in London.</p>
<p>The net proceeds of the sale amounted to &pound;757 4<i>s.</i>
10<i>d.</i>, to which must be added &pound;15 for old store at
the Port of Lynn.&nbsp; In the <i>Stamford Mercury</i> of the
17th September 1802 appeared the following advertisement:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;THE LATE DEPOT
FOR PRISONERS OF WAR<br />
<span class="smcap">Norman Cross-Barracks to Let</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen large buildings, lately occupied as prisons,
with sundry convenient buildings thereto belonging; <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>with square
yards, comprising about an acre of land in each, with good wells
in the centre, and a quantity of land round the prisons fit for
grazing sheep, etc.&nbsp; Also sundry good dwellings, comprising
Turnkeys&rsquo; lodges, stewards&rsquo; rooms, also two good
houses lately occupied by the superintendents, well calculated
for small families&mdash;may be viewed by applying to Mr.
Henderson, Auctioneer, New Inn, Norman Cross.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their instructions to the auctioneer, the Government made
conditions that the tenants were to keep the buildings in repair,
and to deliver them up on three months&rsquo; notice if
required.&nbsp; The property does not read in the advertisement
as one that there would be a rush for.</p>
<p>The landlord of the Old Bell Inn, still in the glory of the
coaching and posting days, apparently treated for the wooden
building, containing the two houses occupied one by Captain
Woodriff the agent and the other by the steward and another
officer, the rental of Captain Woodriff&rsquo;s house to be
&pound;12 and that adjoining &pound;10; but even at that rent he
did not close.</p>
<p>In January 1803 the whole was let to Mr. Henderson, on
condition that he lived on the premises, the barrack master
keeping one key of the great gate.&nbsp; Mr. Henderson paid an
extra sum of &pound;10 for Captain Woodriff&rsquo;s house, which
he probably wished to fit up either for his own residence or for
the man whom he proposed to leave in charge when he was in London
attending to another business which he had there; he also agreed
to level the huts, which are not represented on any of the plans,
and to sow the ground covered by them with grass seeds.</p>
<p>His tenancy lasted only six months.&nbsp; Hostilities
recommenced in May 1803, and on 3rd July Henderson had to hand
over everything to two clerks appointed by the Admiralty.&nbsp;
He pleaded that he had ploughed and sown crops, and claimed
&pound;30 18<i>s.</i> compensation; he received <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>&pound;18
13<i>s.</i>&nbsp; On the whole the Government would probably have
saved money if they had locked the gates when Captain Woodriff,
their agent, left the empty depot in June 1802, kept the keys
themselves, and unlocked them on the 3rd July 1803.</p>
<p>Between those dates much had taken place to affect the history
of the Depot.&nbsp; The complete supremacy of the British Fleet,
the blow given to the Northern Alliance (the Armed Neutrality) by
Nelson in the battle of Copenhagen, and on the other hand the
defeats inflicted on Austria, England&rsquo;s continental ally,
on whom she relied for her land forces, and the consequent Treaty
of Lun&eacute;ville, left England and France alike in a position
which made them in 1802 anxious for a cessation of hostilities,
the Treaty of Amiens being the result.</p>
<p>But its conditions were not such as to satisfy the British,
who gave up all their conquests but Trinidad and Ceylon, restored
the Cape to Holland, with the condition that it should be a free
port, and agreed that Malta was to go back to the Knights of St.
John, under the guarantee of one of the Great Powers.&nbsp;
France also made sacrifices and withdrew claims, but to the
British nation these did not appear to balance those made by
their own Government.&nbsp; Buonaparte had no intention of
allowing the peace to be more than a truce.&nbsp; Among other
objects he had in view, he recovered his veterans from their
confinement in English prisons, and he never paused in his
ambitious schemes.&nbsp; He strove to increase French influence
in Switzerland, Holland, and Italy.&nbsp; Under the name of
consuls he sent agents to England and Ireland, their real object
being to make themselves acquainted with the resources of those
countries and the chance of their successful invasion.&nbsp;
Egypt had been restored to the Porte by the Treaty, but instead
of evacuating that country, the First Consul was utilising his
position there to equip a fresh army.</p>
<p><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>In
the face of these proceedings Britain did not withdraw her troops
from Egypt, nor did she evacuate Malta, which she should have
done in fulfilment of the Article which restored that island to
the Knights of St. John.&nbsp; Angry disputes arose over her
action, or rather want of action, in this matter.&nbsp;
Commenting on the Treaty of Amiens, Count Guillaume de Garden <a
name="citation245"></a><a href="#footnote245"
class="citation">[245]</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;L&rsquo;article est le plus important de
tout le Trait&eacute;, mais aucune des conditions qu&rsquo;il
renferme n&rsquo;a &eacute;t&eacute; ex&eacute;cut&eacute;e et il
est devenu le pr&eacute;texte d&rsquo;une guerre, qui s&rsquo;est
renouvel&eacute;e en 1803 et a dur&eacute; sans interruption
jusqu&rsquo;en 1814.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complaint of the First Consul against the English Press,
and his demands that Britain should alter her laws, putting
restraints on the liberty of the Press, and depriving of their
freedom those living under her protection, roused the indignation
of the country.&nbsp; The British Government prosecuted under her
own laws a Frenchman, M. Peltier, who in articles he had written
had brought himself within the arm of the law of the land, but it
refused to alter those laws at the bidding of another
power.&nbsp; M. Norvus, Napoleon&rsquo;s apologist, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Napoleon demanded from Great Britain what
was nearly the same thing as proposing the sacrifice of its
constitution, and to insist upon its abandoning the two pillars
of its freedom, the liberty of the press, and the privilege of
Habeas Corpus.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>Some
months later Buonaparte in a State paper practically challenged
Great Britain to fight him single-handed, as she would be if war
broke out again.&nbsp; After much fruitless negotiation England
declared war against France on the 16th May 1803, and eleven
years more were added to the active existence of Norman Cross, as
one factor in the gigantic struggle between the two
nations.&nbsp; Six days after the declaration of war, France, by
the First Consul&rsquo;s decree, filled her prisons with the
10,000 British men of all degrees, between the age of eighteen
and sixty, whom she found within her bounds at that date.&nbsp;
This step she justified as a fair reprisal for the action of an
English captain who seized two French merchant vessels before the
declaration of war had reached the French Minister.&nbsp;
Buonaparte knew that a bill for a <i>lev&eacute;e en masse</i>
had been presented to Parliament, and that to secure, before they
could be enrolled, 10,000 of the able-bodied men of the nation,
(the whole of the population at that date was only twelve and a
half million) was a wise step.</p>
<p>Our Admiralty, immediately after the renewal of the war,
called upon the Transport Board to find depots for the parole
prisoners, whom we were taking, in merchant vessels and other
craft, not ships of war.&nbsp; Bishops Waltham and Tavistock were
suggested, and should the numbers be considerable, Oldham and
Tiverton were to be added, while Stapleton Prison was to be
prepared for prisoners of war.&nbsp; This, it will be remembered,
was the third and last time that Stapleton had been requisitioned
for such a purpose, it having been built originally in 1782 to
receive prisoners taken in the war which was ended in the
following year by the Treaty of Versailles.&nbsp; In 1833 it was
converted into a workhouse.</p>
<p>The prisons first suggested, being deemed insufficient,
Peterborough was proposed to the Transport Board, and the Board
replied, that on receipt of an intimation <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>from the
Admiralty, they would make the necessary arrangements for the
reception of prisoners at Norman Cross.</p>
<p>On 18th June 1803 the Admiralty appointed, as agents for
prisoners of war, Captain Thesiger at Portsmouth, Captain Baker
at Stapleton, Captain Pressland at Liverpool, Captain Poulden at
Norman Cross.</p>
<p>In consequence of Stapleton being used instead of Liverpool,
Captain Pressland, R.N., was sent to Norman Cross, at a salary,
in addition to his full pay, of &pound;200 per annum, and
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>per diem</i> for expenses. <a
name="citation247"></a><a href="#footnote247"
class="citation">[247]</a>&nbsp; Thus manned for the work, the
Norman Cross Depot started on the eleven years of arduous work
which lay before it.&nbsp; The agents were to be in supreme
authority, but were not to interfere with the medical or surgical
treatment <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>of the sick, this being entirely in the hands of the
Board of the Sick and Hurt.</p>
<p>Mr. Hadley of Lynn contracted to convey prisoners to and from
Norman Cross on lighters at 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> each, and to
victual them at 7<i>d.</i> each, the military guard being carried
on the same terms.</p>
<p>Prisoners soon arrived, the first detachment being 179
Frenchmen on 28th August.&nbsp; Then came 250 from
Portsmouth.&nbsp; They arrived at Portsmouth on board the
<i>Pegasus</i>, but deprived of the winged horse and reduced to
Shanks&rsquo; pony, their journey from Portsmouth to Norman Cross
took them from the 5th to the 18th September.&nbsp; In October
several detachments arrived, among them one of over 200 French
and 5 Dutch.</p>
<p>Between the years 1803 and 1814 no fewer than 122,440
prisoners of war of various nationalities were brought to Great
Britain, most of them during the years 1805&ndash;10; of these
10,341 died in prison, and 17,607 were exchanged or paroled to
France as invalids. <a name="citation248"></a><a
href="#footnote248" class="citation">[248]</a>&nbsp; Norman Cross
had its full share of this enormous crowd of prisoners, and the
discipline of the prison, the life, and occupation of the
prisoners can have differed little from that of the previous
seven years.&nbsp; The greatly diminished chance of a prisoner
obtaining his freedom by exchange, and the longer duration of
each man&rsquo;s term of durance, must, however, have greatly
aggravated for the worse their mental misery and physical
discomfort.</p>
<p>On the other hand, experience had suggested to the authorities
various details in the treatment of their captives, which were
adopted with the object of bettering their lot.&nbsp; In the
structure of the prison itself there were, during this period,
several important changes.&nbsp; The outer stockade fence was
replaced by the brick wall, within which ran the dry, paved
ditch.&nbsp; The boys&rsquo; separate prison was built in a
bricked-in enclosure, outside the prison wall, through a door in
which was <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>the only entrance into the new enclosure.&nbsp; In 1805
the surgeon&rsquo;s new brick house was built in the hospital
quadrangle, but beyond these points there is nothing special to
add to the description already given.</p>
<p>There would necessarily be the same anxious watching on the
part of the prisoners of the events of the war; they would
probably mock at the 300,000 volunteers, foot and mounted, who
came forward and rendered the <i>lev&eacute;e en masse</i>
unnecessary.&nbsp; With what elation they must have heard of the
Grande Arm&eacute;e de Bretagne, ranged opposite the southern
shore of England, separated only by the narrow channel, across
which 150,000 French soldiers were to be floated by the 2,000
vessels assembled at Boulogne, ready to transport them so soon as
the weather and the supporting fleet for which they were waiting
combined to favour the enterprise!&nbsp; That threatened
invasion, which hung like a black terror over England in those
early years of the nineteenth century, was for them within their
prison walls the bright light of hopeful expectation; and when
the news of the 21st October reached England, the news which was
communicated to Cadet Hopkinson at Verdun, shorn of its glory and
its fateful significance to the French in the taunting words,
&ldquo;Votre Nelson est mort,&rdquo; it would be told to the
prisoners at Norman Cross, in words conveying the whole truth,
&ldquo;Our Nelson has fallen, but not before he had destroyed
your fleet, and your country is now no longer a naval
power.&rdquo;&nbsp; What despair must have again filled their
hearts!&nbsp; If they disbelieved the fact at first, the arrival
of Corporal de la Porte and his comrades, followed by crew after
crew of the captured sailors and soldiers, must have too surely
confirmed the news.</p>
<p>As the years of their captivity dragged on, they would hear of
the conquests and of the King-making by their idol Buonaparte,
now the Emperor Napoleon, and they would look forward in the near
future to a Buonaparte <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>on the throne of George III, and to
their triumphal progress through the conquered country on the way
back to their own dear France.&nbsp; Then their hopes would fade
again (as, alas! their bodily comfort would be decreased) as
there came crowding in the prisoners sent from the Peninsula by
Wellington, who although he had been ordered on the 3rd February
1811 not to send any more prisoners on account of the crowded
state of the prisons, in 1811&ndash;12 sent 20,000. <a
name="citation250"></a><a href="#footnote250"
class="citation">[250]</a>&nbsp; Later on would spread through
the courts the story of the disastrous invasion of Russia and the
awful retreat from Moscow.&nbsp; In the next year, 1813, they
might hear that Wellington had crossed the Bidassoa, and thus
secured for England&mdash;their hated hostess in their accursed
abode at Norman Cross&mdash;the honour of being the first of the
European powers to plant its victorious standard on French
soil.</p>
<p>Hurtful as such items of news&mdash;which reached them solely
through English sources or through equally unsympathetic French
sources, such as the Bishop of Moulins, whose France was not
their France&mdash;were to their patriotic feelings, they were
all tending to bring about the day of their release.&nbsp; In
1814 the Allies invaded France, and successfully advanced upon
Paris.&nbsp; Napoleon abdicated, and was allowed to retire to
Elba, and at length the news reached Norman Cross that on <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>the 30th
May the Treaty of Paris, which meant freedom for all prisoners of
war, had been signed.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Deeply as many an old soldier among the 4,617 of the prisoners
at Norman Cross on that date resented the fall of the hero he had
worshipped, his great general, the Emperor, bitterly as the
majority resented the sight of the white flag of the Bourbons
which had been mounted in each quadrangle, the one dominant
feeling in the breasts of the prisoners was wild joy at their
imminent freedom and restoration to their own loved country; they
embraced, they danced, they sang, and they cried for joy.&nbsp;
The military barracks had not been an abode of luxury or comfort,
and the garrison caught the infection of exuberant joy; a party
of them seized the Glasgow Mail Coach, on its arrival at Stilton,
and drew it to Norman Cross, whither the coachman, horses, and
guard were obliged to follow.</p>
<p>Among the prisoners who witnessed the scenes of rejoicing at
this time was M. Foulley, who had been confined at Norman Cross
for five years and three months.&nbsp; The scene impressed him so
strongly, that after his return to France he made a model of the
Depot as it appeared during the celebration of the departure of
the first detachment of liberated prisoners for France.&nbsp;
This model has already been criticised and described in Chapter
II, but the place for the photograph is here, in the last chapter
of this volume.&nbsp; The figures in the quadrangles, the
garrison drawn up in line, with its back to the prison, at
attention, ready to salute the departing prisoners, who only a
day before it had to guard with loaded muskets and fixed
bayonets, tell of the buried hatchet, of the new-born peace
between France and England, which has endured for ninety-eight
years, and which is cemented and invigorated by the existing
<i>entente cordiale</i>.</p>
<p>The prisoners began to prepare for departure.&nbsp; Some would
set to work with a will to finish articles which <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>had been
bespoken, or which they wished to put in the market before their
departure.&nbsp; Some could afford to take their stock of
knick-knacks home, and would have money to draw from the agent
and clerks&mdash;money they had realised by their work during the
past eleven years.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, in some instances, the sum
earned amounted to as much as one, two, or three hundred pounds,
but without seeing the banking account, it will hardly be
credited that any prisoner had actually made the rumoured
thousand pounds. <a name="citation252"></a><a href="#footnote252"
class="citation">[252]</a>&nbsp; Others would pack the articles
they were taking home as memorials of their long sojourn in the
land of their enemy.&nbsp; Every one would be in some way
preparing for departure.&nbsp; Some permitted on parole would
have to bid farewell to the friends they had made within their
bounds, others would have to write to friends made in the market
or in conversations surreptitiously carried on through the pales
of the stockade fences.</p>
<p>Speedily, detachments began to move off.&nbsp; The Depot had
been costing &pound;300,000 a year, and every day it remained
full represented a large sum.&nbsp; The local newspapers, where
formerly they described the prisoners making their weary way
under a strong escort from the coast to Norman Cross were now
filled with reports of parties of released prisoners marching to
the coast in comparative freedom.&nbsp; One paper notes how, of a
detachment of 500, some got so drunk (is it much to be wondered
at?) that they could not go on; while, on the contrary on 6th
May, according to the <i>Cambridge Chronicle</i>, another
detachment of 200, which was to embark from Chatham, passing
through Cambridge on their way to that port, walked about the
town and the University buildings, conducting themselves in an
orderly manner.</p>
<p><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>So
detachment followed detachment, until in the <i>Times</i> of 19th
August 1814 appeared a paragraph, &ldquo;Of all the great body of
Prisoners of War, who were lately at Norman Cross Barracks, at
this time only one single prisoner remains, and he, in
consequence of illness preventing his removal.&rdquo;&nbsp; What
must have been this poor fellow&rsquo;s feelings when he knew
that all his fellow prisoners had left for their native
country.&nbsp; Was he happily unconscious?&nbsp; We are sure that
everything possible would be done to lighten his sad fate.&nbsp;
Probably he was the last of his countrymen to be laid in the now
desolate cemetery. <a name="citation253a"></a><a
href="#footnote253a" class="citation">[253a]</a></p>
<p>One shudders to think that his disappointment may have been as
heartrending as that of the poor prisoner whose fate is narrated
by Basil Thomson.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On 20th June, when the last draft was being
formed, it happened that one unfortunate man could not produce
his bedding; probably it had been stolen by others to make up
their complement.&nbsp; On being refused at the gate, he rushed
frantically back into his prison to look for it, and then,
fearful of being left behind, he ran back to the gate to plead
his cause with the guard.&nbsp; On being again refused he became
frantic with grief, and crying that he had been eleven years in
prison, in an agony of despair he pulled out his knife, and there
before the guards and his own countrymen cut his throat.&nbsp;
There is no more sorrowful incident in the history of
Dartmoor.&rdquo; <a name="citation253b"></a><a
href="#footnote253b" class="citation">[253b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the gate closed behind that man who had been left in
Norman Cross on the 19th August, it closed for the last time on a
prisoner.&nbsp; The campaign of a hundred <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>days which
followed between the escape of Napoleon from Elba and his final
defeat at Waterloo sent no prisoners to the Depot, and in 1816
the buildings were demolished and the site sold.&nbsp; The sale,
including that of the remaining stores, furniture, and fixtures,
occupied thirteen days and realised only &pound;11,060 4<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> <a name="citation254"></a><a href="#footnote254"

<p>In Peterborough, Stilton, and the neighbouring villages much
of the material sold was re-erected and is still in use; but on
the site itself, the houses of the barrack master, the agent, and
the steward, the wells, the wide fosse which ran round inside the
outer wall, and about 60 yards of the wall itself, alone remain
of that Norman Cross Prison which, for twenty years in the most
eventful period in the history of Europe, played so important a
part; over which, and its inmates, the two Governments, French
and English, argued and fought, while the prisoners
suffered.&nbsp; That prison, where these victims of war&mdash;our
foemen, it is true, but patriots, and foemen worthy of our
steel&mdash;pined in prolonged confinement, surrounded by prison
walls, held down by cannon, muskets, and bayonets, hoping for
release which never came, enduring an agonising longing for
freedom&mdash;a longing so keen that many of them purchased it by
enlisting in the ranks of Britain, their country&rsquo;s
enemy&mdash;and suffering, alas! other miseries, of which not the
least was the moral deterioration and degradation consequent on
their condition and surroundings.&nbsp; <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>Gone are
the prisons and their miseries, gone the barracks and their busy
life of active duties, and gone, also, all personal recollection
of the great events of 1789 to 1816, of which the life here was a
part.</p>
<p>But, standing on the great North Road, between the two fields,
the one to the right and the other to the left, nothing to
distinguish them from the thousands of similar fields in every
county of England, the reader will, if this narrative has in a
measure aroused in him the interest with which the writer has
hoped to inspire him, be able to call up in his mind&rsquo;s eye
the Norman Cross of a hundred years ago.&nbsp; The courts, the
caserns, and the various other buildings rise before him; he sees
them filled with the Dutch and French sailors and soldiers who
for years lived in the one field, and of whom nearly two thousand
for ever sleep in the other.&nbsp; The vision fades, and the
gazer realises that of it nothing remains but a name, the
beautiful works of art made by the prisoners, some musty
documents, in the Public Record Office or British Museum, and
1,770 skeletons in the undistinguished field on the North
Road.&nbsp; Before him lies the site of Norman Cross Prison, a
typical scene of sylvan calm.</p>
<blockquote><p>We pass; the path that each man trod<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is dim, or will be dim with woods:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What fame is left for human deeds<br />
In endless age? it rests with God.</p>

259</span>APPENDIX A</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">A REPORT OF THE SURVEY OF THE DEPOT FOR
PRISONERS OF WAR AT NORMAN CROSS 31<span class="smcap">st</span>
MAY 1813</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm">By <span
class="smcap">Mr. Fearnall</span>, Surveyor</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Prisons, or Barracks, are built
of fir quartering, and weather boarded on the outside, and have
no inside lining, except those appropriated for the hospital,
which are plastered.&nbsp; The innumerable holes cut through all
parts of the buildings by the prisoners for the admission of
light have caused them to be extremely weak, by the braces being
cut through and destroyed in many parts, so as to render it
necessary they should be immediately replaced with new, and such
regulations adopted towards the prisoners as to prevent a
recurrence of the same practice.&nbsp; The weather-boarding,
stair-cases, hammock rails, privies and fence are in a general
bad state, as particularly stated in this report, viz.:</p>
<p><i>Prison No.</i> 1.&mdash;The ground floor is paved with
stone, which is in many parts broken and very irregular.&nbsp;
The story posts, that support the roof and floor, are so much
damaged by being cut by the prisoners, and in parts decayed, as
to require to be new in many places.&nbsp; The upper floor in the
gangway, which has hitherto been laid with elm board, is stated
to require renewing every twenty months; the other parts of the
floor very much decayed.&nbsp; The hammock rails in many parts
worn out.&nbsp; The braces and quarterings of the building are
very much cut and destroyed by the prisoners, and must be new in
many places.&nbsp; The stair-case in very bad condition, quite
worn out.&nbsp; As they are now constructed within the building,
they impede a free circulation of air, and occupy a space which
would allow <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>twelve men to be berthed, in addition to the present
number, by having an accommodation ladder against the outside of
the building, with a landing place and door; this plan would stop
the communication between the two prison rooms, facilitate the
escape of the prisoners in case of fire, by having two doors
instead of only one.&nbsp; Mr. Walker, the surgeon, is very
desirous that the same alteration should be made at the Hospital;
it would separate the two wards, which in case of infectious
diseases would be attended with beneficial effects, also save the
expense of opening another ward in case of contagion.</p>
<p>The weather-boarding, from the prisoners cutting holes through
for the admission of light, to each berth, as well as from actual
decay, is in such bad condition as to require at least one third
to be new.</p>
<p><i>Privy</i>.&mdash;The weather-boarding and wood steps in bad
condition, and many pantiles stripped from the roof.&nbsp; The
ground under the privies on which the soil cart stands, from the
frequency of its being drawn out, has occasioned deep ruts, so
that when the cart is drawn out, it comes up with a jerk, and the
soil is thrown out, and becomes a dreadful nuisance, which might
be prevented by a few stumps of wood driven into the ground, on
which a piece of oak plank might form a railway, and the
intermediate space be filled up with stone rubbish at a very
trifling expense.</p>
<p><i>Court between the Buildings</i>.&mdash;Are paved next the
Barracks only, and in wet weather, the part not paved, from the
nature of the soil, is in a miserable condition, and would be
very much improved by paving the whole, leaving a gutter-way in
the middle of the court; every shower of rain would cleanse it,
and add very much to the comfort of the prisoners.</p>
<p><i>Cook Room</i>.&mdash;Stone floor broken; requires to be
relayed and raised.&nbsp; Weather-boarding, quartering and area
gutters require repair.&nbsp; The dressers are of deal and worn
out; recommend they should be made of elm plank.</p>
<p><i>Butchery</i>.&mdash;The floor in bad condition, the sashes
decayed, the weather-boarding and area gutters require
repair.&nbsp; The paving of the cellar under the butchery should
be relayed.&nbsp; The effluvia from a cesspool under the pavement
are very offensive in the Stewards&rsquo; apartments immediately
above it, <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>the floor of which should be plugged to prevent the
smell passing through the open joists of the floor.</p>
<p><i>Black Hole</i>.&mdash;The roof breaking through.&nbsp; The
fence of the covered walk is in part decayed and should be
new.</p>
<p><i>Outside Fence at the End of the Barracks</i>.&mdash;The
post rails and paling are generally decayed, and require
considerable repair, and in many parts must be new.</p>
<p><i>Tanks for the purpose of Washing</i>,
<i>etc.</i>&mdash;They are made of wood, and the greater part
decayed.</p>
<p><i>Gates and Fence to the Quadrangles</i>.&mdash;Are very much
decayed and were never sufficiently strong and secure for the
purpose intended, the gate; require to be all new, the fence
needs considerable repair, and in that part next the gates,
should be entirely new and raised much higher.</p>
<p><i>Watch Box</i>.&mdash;Required for the Turnkey at the west
gate.</p>
<p><i>Pavement within the Quadrangles</i>.&mdash;In indifferent
condition, and requires relaying in many places.&nbsp; A path is
paved all round the quadrangles; in the middle where it is not
paved, it is impassable in bad weather, except through mud.&nbsp;
Captain Hanwell is desirous that a path should be paved across
the middle.</p>
<p><i>Wells</i>.&mdash;Are in tolerable condition, with the
exception of one, the brick-lining of which within about forty
feet of the bottom has fallen in, and rendered the well useless;
the remainder of the brick-work is in such a dangerous state,
that no person will venture down to repair it.</p>
<p><i>French Officers&rsquo; Apartments in No.</i> 8.&mdash;The
floor and staircase in very bad condition, and the circulation of
air too much confined.&nbsp; Might be remedied by having a
lattice instead of a close partition.</p>
<p><i>Offices</i>.&mdash;Captain Harwell&rsquo;s and the other
offices in tolerable condition, require painting and
whitewashing; the first clerk&rsquo;s office has been papered
long since, and it is falling from the wall.</p>
<p><i>Storeroom</i>.&mdash;Under the same roof as above, the
weather-boarding and floors require repair, the hammocks and
bales of clothing are liable to injury from being in contact with
the inside of the decayed weather-board.&nbsp; Recommend it
should be lined with &frac34;-inch planed deal, 6 feet above the
floor.</p>
<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span><i>Hospital</i>.&mdash;The buildings appropriated for
the hospital are in better condition than the other, have lath
and plaster lining within, and the weather-boarding, stair-cases,
floor, etc., want less repairs.</p>
<p><i>Officers&rsquo; Accommodation</i>.&mdash;Agent&rsquo;s
house is built of wood and plastered on the outside, containing a
basement, parlour, one pair story, and attics, two rooms on each
story, the largest room measures 16 feet by 13 feet, the small
room 11 feet 6 inches by 9 feet 6 inches.&nbsp; The Agent&rsquo;s
house is said to have been partially painted and papered in the
year 1808; the attics, the back parlour, and the kitchen were not
done at that time, and Mr. Todd informed me that they have not
been painted since the house was built.&nbsp; Mr. Todd, the
storekeeper, and Mr. Gardiner, the chief clerk, have their
accommodation under the same roof as the Agent and contain the
same number of rooms divided as follows: Mr. Todd occupies the
one pair story and one garret, Mr. Gardiner the ground floor and
one garret, Mr. Todd the back kitchen, Mr. Gardiner the
front.&nbsp; The before mentioned apartments are said to have
been painted in the year 1808.&nbsp; The surgeon has a good
brick-built house, the rooms were papered before the walls were
dry, the damp has destroyed the paper of four rooms; this house
is said not to have been painted since built, about eight years
since.&nbsp; The dispenser has three small rooms, and the
hospital-mate two.&nbsp; The stewards have each two very small
rooms under the same roof as, and leading out of the butchery,
except the hospital steward, who is not very properly
accommodated in prison No. 8, separated from the French Officers
by a thin deal partition only; the space formerly allotted for
the hospital steward is now the hospital store.&nbsp; This seems
to require that it should return to its original plan for two
reasons; first, the hospital steward is removed from his duty,
and secondly, he is placed in communication with the French
Officers, by the deal partition which separates them being cut
through in holes.&nbsp; There is a vacant space at the end of the
building next the dispenser&rsquo;s and matron&rsquo;s rooms, on
which an hospital store might be built, which would admit of the
steward having his proper apartments.</p>
<p>The stewards are respectable men, and with their wives <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>and
children have only a common privy, to which all the French cooks
have access, and the path to which is exposed to the whole of the
prisoners.&nbsp; Submit that a small room and privy may be added
to the steward&rsquo;s accommodation, as desired by Captain
Hanwell.</p>
<p>The sempstress who is now with the matron, and the clerk of
the small beer, who is accommodated in communication with the
French Officers in No. 8, being late appointments, have no other
accommodation; they might be provided for, by building a small
place at the end of the wash-house.&nbsp; The matron and
sempstress have no access to the drying room without passing
round the whole buildings, which in bad weather would be more
convenient by having an entrance through the tool-house with a
door at the end.</p>
<p><i>Boundary Wall</i>.&mdash;From the east gate to the north
gate, and from the east gate towards the south, is from 7 inches
to 11 inches within a perpendicular, and appears to be very
indifferently built, and not of the best materials; and, from the
earth outside, being 5 feet higher than that within, the lateral
pressure has forced in the wall, which they have endeavoured to
prevent by introducing land tyes, and there is no doubt if they
had been properly executed, these would have answered the desired
purpose.&nbsp; I sent for the master bricklayer that built the
wall, by contract.&nbsp; He informed me that the piles to the
land tyes were at least 7 feet long, but observing that the wall
had given way since the tyes were put in, I had the earth cleared
and drew one of the piles, when, instead of being 7, they were
only 3 feet long, and totally insufficient to hold the wall, and,
if not prevented, the wall, land tyes, etc., will all fall into
the ditch.&nbsp; To secure the wall will require that thirty-two
new land tyes, and additional piles of at least 10 feet long,
should be driven to secure the old tyes, and to be placed as
described to Captain Hanwell.&nbsp; The wall being built in such
long lengths, being near 400 feet of straight lines, with a
weight of earth against the outside, could not be expected to
stand; there should have been a ditch on the outside, the same as
that within, not only for the security of the wall, but to
prevent the facility now afforded, of communication over the
wall, it being only 9 feet high on the outside.&nbsp; Had it been
<a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>built
with an angle as marked with a pencil on the plan, it would not
only have been infinitely stronger, but it would admit of the
prisoners being better guarded, by the sentinels, stationed at
the angle, flanking the wall each way.&nbsp; I submit for the
Board&rsquo;s consideration whether the middle of the wall, that
has given way, had not better be taken down and rebuilt with an
angle as described, or whether it shall be secured in its present
form with land tyes.</p>
<p>I am of opinion it would require the sum of &pound;5,000 to
complete the whole of the works mentioned in the aforegoing
report of the Survey, one half of which might be expended this
year, and the remainder to complete the whole in the year
1814.&nbsp; Captain Hanwell informs me that he can employ 36
carpenters, 2 pair of sawyers, and 3 masons from among the
prisoners; the carpenters&rsquo; work can be done by them, but
the principal part of the masons&rsquo; and bricklayers&rsquo;
work, I submit, should be done by contract as heretofore, under
the direction of the agent; it will also be necessary to contract
for a supply of timber and deals, converted into the different
scantlings required.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">SHORT BIOGRAPHY OF CAPTAIN WOODRIFF, R.N.,
AGENT AT THE DEPOT, 1799&ndash;1802</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Captain Woodriff</span> belonged to a
naval family, his father and brothers and son all being officers
of various ranks.&nbsp; He must have been ninety years old at his
death in 1842, as according to the return of his services in the
Admiralty records, filled and signed himself, he entered the navy
as gunner&rsquo;s mate on the <i>Ludlow Castle</i>, 12th August
1762.</p>
<p>He served as midshipman in various parts of the world,
becoming lieutenant in 1782, and commander in 1795, this
commission carrying the brevet rank of captain.</p>
<p>He acted as Agent of Transports at Southampton, being
appointed Resident there as from 2nd September 1796 at a salary
of 21<i>s.</i> a day, in addition to his half-pay, and &pound;50
a year for a clerk.&nbsp; This office necessitated his travelling
much to the various ports, and in one of his voyages, the vessel
carrying cash belonging to him was captured by the Dutch, but the
Admiralty reimbursed him.</p>
<p>As we have seen, he was very actively superintending the
arrival and distribution of prisoners of war at Hull, Yarmouth
and Lynn in the early days of Norman Cross, to which Depot he was
appointed Agent in 1799; he filled the post up to the Peace of
Amiens, giving every satisfaction to the Admiralty and Transport
Board, though on one occasion he was reprimanded for striking a
French prisoner, even though the blow was given under great
provocation.</p>
<p>His commission as Post Captain was dated 28th April 1802, and
he was appointed to command the <i>Calcutta</i>, a ship of 74
guns to convoy convicts to Botany Bay.&nbsp; He was next ordered
to St. Helena, to collect a convoy of East Indiamen; there were
four full ships, a Prussian <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>ship and a Swedish ship which
claimed protection.&nbsp; They sailed on the 3rd August, and on
14th September picked up a leaky ship called <i>The Brothers</i>,
which had become separated from another convoy.&nbsp; The bad
condition of this vessel was the cause of all the subsequent
trouble.&nbsp; Her bad sailing delayed the others, and off the
Scilly Islands Woodriff was attacked by a French squadron of ten
ships, one being a three-decker of 110 guns, with a crew of 1,100
men, four 74-gun ships, three 40-gun, and two brigs.</p>
<p>Finding it impossible to save both the convoy and himself, he
ordered the convoy to make all sail to the north and escape,
while he stayed and fought for some hours.</p>
<p>Over fifty minutes he was engaged with the three-decker, and
the fight was under full sail as he steered to the south to
enable the convoy to escape.&nbsp; The superior strength and
overwhelming numbers of the French dismantled the
<i>Calcutta</i>, so to prevent loss of life he hauled down his
flag and surrendered, and <i>The Brothers</i>, which was leaky
and could not escape, was also captured.</p>
<p>The crews were not at once landed in France, but remained on
the French ships for four months.&nbsp; At the end of that time
they were landed at Rochelle, and kept at an hotel for eighteen
days at great expense.&nbsp; Then Captain Woodriff and his
officers, an East India colonel and his lady, and two gentlemen
from the East Indies, hired a carriage to take them to
Verdun.&nbsp; They were escorted all the way by troops; the
journey lasted thirty-six days and cost each of the prisoners
&pound;40.</p>
<p>In the Admiralty return of his services, there is a modest
little note, &ldquo;Returned from France, June 1807,&rdquo; but
the circumstances attending his return are so extraordinary as to
demand attention.&nbsp; He had made repeated applications to
Talleyrand for release, but without avail.&nbsp; In June 1807, he
received an order, signed by Buonaparte, in Poland, directing him
to proceed immediately to England, and to take the route of St.
Malves, a town no Englishman was permitted to enter.&nbsp; On his
arrival there, he received from an agent of the French Government
the letters which had been directed to him at Verdun.&nbsp; He
proceeded to hire a vessel to take him to England, for which he
was prepared <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>to pay forty or fifty guineas, but was told that a
vessel was provided for him by the French Government, free of any
expense whatever.</p>
<p>Our Government, not to be outdone in this unexpected
generosity on the part of the enemy, immediately released a
French officer of equal rank, who returned to France on terms of
equal liberality.&nbsp; On his return to England Captain Woodriff
was tried by court-martial for the loss of his ship the
<i>Calcutta</i>, but after evidence, &ldquo;The Court agreed that
the conduct of Captain Woodriff was that of a brave, cool, and
intrepid officer; and did adjudge him, his officers, and
ship&rsquo;s company to be most honourably acquitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owners and underwriters of one of the East Indiamen he had
saved from capture raised a subscription for the officers and
crew, which amounted to about &pound;4,000.</p>
<p>On the 29th July 1808 Captain Woodriff was appointed Agent for
Prisoners of War at Forton.</p>
<p>In December 1813 he was appointed Commissioner of the navy at
Jamaica.&nbsp; He refused flag rank and was admitted to Greenwich
Hospital, 9th November 1830, where he died 24th February 1842. <a
name="citation267"></a><a href="#footnote267"
class="citation">[267]</a></p>
<p>Captain Woodriff was undoubtedly an able and hardworking
officer, and he was fortunate in having to assist him the
influence of Sir Evan Nepean, Secretary of the Admiralty, himself
an able administrator and industrious official, whose
correspondence at times exhibits traits of personal kindness and
consideration, as rare as valuable in official letters.</p>

270</span>INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO APPENDIX D</h3>
<p>Two years ago I received from Mr. W. T. Mellows, Solicitor of
Peterborough, the loan of an imperfect copy of a Parliamentary
paper endorsed, &ldquo;Supplement 1801 to Appendix No. 59, Report
of the Transport Board to the House of Commons 1798, being
correspondence with the French Government relative to Prisoners
of War.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fragment contained, as far as I
recollect, thirty-eight out of the fifty-eight or fifty-nine
letters enumerated in the index of contents.&nbsp; Those missing
were apparently so important that I went to the British Museum to
search through the Parliamentary Reports for this appendix.&nbsp;
Failing to find the document, I left the imperfect copy with the
assistant librarian, who finally returned it to me, saying that
extraordinary as it was, this supplement was not in the Museum
library.&nbsp; A search in the library of the House of Commons,
in which I was assisted by Mr. George Greenwood, M.P., gave the
same result&mdash;this supplement was not to be found.&nbsp; I
have now to acknowledge that last year this unique but imperfect
copy disappeared while under my care&mdash;my own impression is
that it was lost in its travels through an intermediary from my
hands to those of the typist.&nbsp; Fortunately I had already
included some of the letters in the text of this work, and Mr. W.
T. Mellows, intending to present the document to the Museum when
I had done with it, had made his clerk copy six of the letters
and an extract from the report of Commissioner Serle; these I
reproduce in this appendix, regretting deeply that I am unable to
publish the whole of the thirty-eight letters which were once in
my possession, but are now lost and probably destroyed.&mdash;T.

1801 TO APPENDIX NO. 59, REPORT OF THE TRANSPORT BOARD TO THE

GOVERNMENT RELATIVE TO PRISONERS OF WAR</p>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a former period of the present
War it became necessary in order to vindicate the Character of
this Country for good Faith and Humanity, to render publick the
Proceedings and Correspondence of the Governments of Great
Britain and France with respect to Prisoners of War.&nbsp; The
whole was submitted to a Committee of the House of Commons and
became the subject of a Report, followed by certain Resolutions
unanimously adopted by the House.&nbsp; The following
Correspondence may be considered as a Supplement to the Documents
which were printed with that Report, and the motives for
rendering it publick are the same as on the former occasion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lords</span>,</p>
<p>In the absence of Mr. Secretary Dundas, I lost no time in
laying before the King your Lordship&rsquo;s Letter to Him of the
12th Instant inclosing the Communication made to Captain Cotes at
Paris, respecting the future maintenance of the English and
French Prisoners of War, now detained in respective
Countries.</p>
<p>It is the less necessary on this Occasion, to recall the
Circumstances which gave rise to the Arrangement under <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>which Two
Governments agreed to provide for the wants of their respective
subjects during their Detention as they have been submitted to
Parliament and published to the World, in Refutation of the false
and unwarrantable Assertions brought forward by the French
Government on this Subject; but His Majesty cannot witness the
Termination of an Arrangement, founded on the fairest principles
of Justice and Protection, due by the Powers at War to their
respective Prisoners, and proved by Experience to be the best
calculated to provide for their Comfort, without protesting
against this Departure (on the Part of the French Government)
from an Agreement entered into between the Two Countries, and
which tended so materially to mitigate the Calamities of War.</p>
<p>To prevent the Effect of this Alteration as much as possible
with respect to the British Prisoners not on Parole in this
Country, it is His Majesty&rsquo;s Command that from the Date of
the French Agent, ceasing to supply them, the Commissioners of
Transports and for taking care of Prisoners of War, should
furnish them indiscriminately with the same Rations of Provisions
as were granted before the late Arrangement took place.</p>
<p>As no mention is made of Clothing, or other necessaries, in
Captain Cotes&rsquo; letter, I think it right to add that the
Commissioners of Transports and for taking care of Prisoners of
War are on no Account to furnish any to the French Prisoners, as
this Charge has at all times been supported by the French.</p>
<p>It will be proper that his letter should be communicated to
Monsieur Niou the French Agent in London, and to the Agents at
the several Depots of Prisoners, in order that the real Grounds
of the Change which is about to take place, may not be mistaken
or misrepresented.</p>

(Signed) <span class="smcap">Portland</span>.</p>
<p>To the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
&amp;c.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>Having received Directions from the Consuls of the Republic to
inform you of a Measure they have adopted <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>upon an
important Deliberation, the Principles and Bearings of which they
are perfectly well known to you, I have felt it my duty to
address myself directly to you in order to guard against
delay.</p>
<p>The Consuls of the Republic having been engaged in an
Investigation of its Interests, both at home and abroad, have
turned their attention to the mode at present observed by France
and England with respect to the Subsistence and Treatment of
Prisoners of War in the Hands of these two belligerent
Powers.</p>
<p>They have caused all the papers relative to the Adoption of
this system to be carefully examined and a report having been
made to them in this subject they perceive.</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; That in your letter to the Lords of the Admiralty
of the 6th of October 1797 after having claimed the Admission of
Captain Cotes into France and the Exchange or at least the
Liberation on Parole of Sir Sidney Smith, you proposed in order
to put an end to the Recriminations relative to the Treatment of
Prisoners continually renewed on both sides that the Prisoners
should be furnished in the Country where they were detained with
Clothing, Subsistence, and Medicines at the Expence of the
Government to which they belonged.</p>
<p>2ndly.&nbsp; That the said Arrangement took place in
consequence of the Communications respecting this Proposal made
to M. Charretie the French Commissary by the Commissioners of the
Transport Office on the 12th October and the 13th November
following in pursuance of the orders of the Lords of the
Admiralty.</p>
<p>I shall not revert here, Sir, to the circumstances which
preceded this Arrangement, but it is my Duty to declare to you,
that the Consuls of the Republic having remarked that it was not
founded upon any authentic Stipulation, that the Cartel of
Exchange signed nearly Ten Months afterwards took not the least
notice of it and that it was an obvious contradiction of all the
usages and Laws of War, were of opinion, that on the one Hand,
the further execution of it was derogatory both to the Interests
and to the Dignity of the Republic, and, on the other that
neither the good Faith the Government wishes to manifest on every
occasion, nor <a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>the peculiar solicitude it owes to its Fellow Citizens,
did in any manner call upon it to continue to observe this
Arrangement.</p>
<p>Indeed, Sir, you have yourself declared, in your letter of the
6th October 1797 the one of the Motives which led you to wish for
this Arrangement, was the Difficulty of judging whether the
Complaints of the Prisoners were well or ill founded; that some
of these Complaints were dictated by Passion by Prejudice or
Animosity, whilst others arose solely from the Difference in
their Mode of Living, and in the same Letter you acknowledged
that the belligerent Powers in preceding Wars when the Account of
Expences incurred for their respective Prisoners came to be
adjusted admitted only the sums advanced for their Clothing.</p>
<p>The principal Motives alleged by you, Sir, were therefore the
necessity of putting an end to the Complaints of the Prisoners
and the Benefit they would derive from being subsisted and
treated in a Manner conformable to their former Habits.</p>
<p>These motives were undoubtedly sufficient in support of your
Proposal and although you added that War, though giving to the
Captors an incontestable right over the Discipline and the Police
of their Prisoners does not however impose upon them the
Obligation of providing for their Wants you would certainly mean
to allude to their secondary Wants only and in Proof of this the
English Government, as you have already declared, always
understood that it must have provided what was absolutely
necessary for the subsistence of the French Prisoners even on the
Supposition that none of the Demands contained in your letter had
been acceded to.&nbsp; The respect paid by all civilized Nations
to the immutable Laws of Humanity and the Empire of those Laws
over the English Nation will not allow me to give any other
Construction to your statement.</p>
<p>The result of this explanation, Sir, is that the mode adopted
since November 1797 for the Subsistence and Treatment of
Prisoners of War, had chiefly in view to ameliorate their
Condition; the Consuls of the Republic in declining to observe
this Mode any longer for the reasons before stated are
nevertheless determined to neglect no means in order to ensure
the same effect.</p>
<p><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>They
have, in consequence, ordered me to assure you, that from the 1st
of Nivose next when all remittances of money from England to
France and from France to England for the Subsistence and
Treatment of Prisoners of War are to cease your Countrymen in
France shall be treated whether in Health or Sickness with every
attention due to their Rank and Situation and that with a View to
their Food being better adapted to their Mode of Living in their
own Country; they shall receive both ashore and in any other
Place of Detention the Ration fixed by the Fourth Article of the
Cartel of Exchange.</p>
<p>As this Order of things will place France and England with
regard to the Prisoners made by each of the Two Powers on the
Footing on which they have stood previous to the 25th of November
1797 the Consuls of the French Republic desire that the English
Commissary at Paris and the French Commissary at London may not
interfere after the first of Nivose next in any Details relative
to the Prisoners of War except in the cases specified in the 3rd
Article of the Cartel of the 13th September 1798.</p>
<p>They have particularly directed me to assure you that the said
Cartel shall be executed with that strict Attention to good
Faith, which will characterize all the Acts of the French Consuls
and that, if they have felt it their duty under the present
Circumstances to re-establish the former System of Management
with respect to Prisoners of War, they at the same time,
understand that the two belligerent Powers may on the Return of a
General Peace bring forward such Claims for Compensation as may
then be deemed necessary.</p>

<p>Inclosed, I transmit a packet for M. Otto from which you will
observe, that notwithstanding all I have done, or can do to
prevent the Prisoners from selling their ration of Provisions for
Days to come, and their Bedding, it has not had, nor is likely to
have the desired effect.</p>
<p>Since the commencement of the Wet weather many of them have
been taken to the Hospital in a very weak state, in consequence
of having sold their Provisions and Bedding and One or Two have
died.</p>
<p>Several of the French Prisoners are without Clothing and
having sold their Bedding they are destitute of either, and the
present wet weather and the approaching winter will if they be
not clothed fill the Hospitals.</p>
<p>I have, Gentlemen, thought it prudent to mention these
circumstances to you, as I am firmly of opinion, that unless some
clothing is issued to the Prisoners who are now destitute many of
them will die should the Winter be severe.</p>

<p><i>The Commissary of the French Republick in England</i>,
<i>To the Commissioners of the Transport Office</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>
<p>I have had the honour of making various Representations to you
relative to the insufficiency of the Ration allowed by the
British Government to the French Prisoners whom the Fortune of
War has thrown into its hands.&nbsp; The fatal effects of this
Diminution of Food are already but too sensibly felt.&nbsp; I
have now before me a list of those who have died and I perceive
that the Number is almost Four times greater than that of last
year at the same period, for during the course of One month only,
the number of deaths has amounted to One Hundred And Ten while
they did not exceed twenty during the same month of the preceding
year.&nbsp; But this comparison however afflicting it may appear
is only the first outline of the Picture, I shall be obliged to
lay before you in a few months unless the most effectual means
are speedily adopted in order to prevent the consequences which
must otherwise result from the wretched situation of the
Prisoners.&nbsp; Indeed it is impossible to look at the state of
the different depots without being convinced of the fate which
infallibly awaits them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be useless to state the misery endured by the
Prisoners here (writes my Correspondent at Norman Cross) many of
them hasten by their own Imprudence or Misconduct the Fate which
awaits them all, if things remain in the state they now
are.&nbsp; Hunger compels them to sell everything they possess
and in so doing they only add to their own wretchedness.&nbsp;
Many are literally naked.&nbsp; Amongst those who by their
Fortitude and good Conduct have avoided these excesses are to be
perceived the melancholy and slow, but certain Effects of a
ruined constitution, and if an immediate remedy is not applied, a
cruel death must soon terminate their sufferings.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>These
details, Gentlemen, are accompanied by bitter Reflections which I
forbear to repeat.&nbsp; I shall also pass over in Silence the
Accounts received from the other Depots which would only be an
afflicting repetition of what you have just read.&nbsp; The
Ration issued to the Prisoners proved insufficient even during
the fine weather.&nbsp; On this Point I appeal to Persons who
have seen the Prisons and experience is a sufficient Proof of
it.&nbsp; Urged by the most pressing wants, the Prisoners have
employed their small Resources in making up the Deficiency of the
Ration.&nbsp; Those who were without pecuniary means Sold even
their Clothing.&nbsp; They are now naked and enfeebled by
Privations of every kind.&nbsp; The keen air of Winter will
sharpen the cravings of Hunger and they must soon experience the
Severity of cold Weather without possessing the means of
defending themselves against it.</p>
<p>Such is the situation of French Prisoners in England.&nbsp; In
France, on the contrary, the English, the Russians, and the
Austrians, who have fallen into our hands, not only receive a
wholesome and plentiful Subsistence, but are clothed at the
expense of the Republic and enjoy a Degree of Liberty which the
French Prisoners are not allowed in this Country.&nbsp; At every
Period of the War, a great Number of Prisoners have had
permission to leave the depots to carry on different trades and
to earn by the Fruits of their Labour even more than would have
provided them with a comfortable support.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the intentions of the British Government with
respect to the Frenchmen now groaning in Irons I request, in the
name of Humanity, and the sacred Law of Nations that you will lay
before that Government this Picture of their Situation.&nbsp; It
cannot fail to affect every feeling mind.&nbsp; It has already
made an impression upon you, Gentlemen, and you have ordered a
great number of Invalids to be sent home.&nbsp; The Agents
entrusted with the charge of selecting the Prisoners falling
under this description have discharged their duty in the most
humane manner and I owe to you as well as to them my grateful
Thanks for their Conduct on this Occasion.</p>
<p>I cannot conclude this letter without replying to two
Objections which may appear at first sight to palliate the
Difference of Treatment experienced by the Prisoners of the <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>Two Nations
&ldquo;The Republic (it has been said) may easily provide for the
subsistence of English Prisoners because there are very few in
France.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if the Chance of War has thrown a
greater number of Prisoners into the Power of Great Britain the
Duties of Humanity ought certainly to plead more forcibly in
their favour in proportion as their numbers Increase at the
respective Depots.&nbsp; And on the other Hand, ought not the
Russians, the Austrians, the Neapolitans and the Bavarians now
Prisoners in France to be taken into the account?&nbsp; Their
number is at least equal to that of the French confined in
England.&nbsp; Are they not subsisted at the expence of the
Republic?&nbsp; And do not the Subsidies paid to their respective
Sovereigns appear to assimilate them to British Subjects?</p>
<p>I have also been told &ldquo;That the People here are not
better fed than the Prisoners.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the scarcity of
Provisions is so notorious that Government notwithstanding its
Solicitude cannot relieve the wants of the people, why should
Government unnecessarily increase the Consumption by feeding more
than 22,000 individuals?&nbsp; I have already had the Honour of
laying before you two Proposals on this subject, namely that of
ransoming the Prisoners, or that of sending them back to France
on Parole.&nbsp; Either of these alternatives would afford an
effectual remedy for the Evil in question; the Plan of Parole has
already been adopted with respect to French Fishermen.&nbsp; No
complaint of want of punctuality in this Arrangement has hitherto
arisen.&nbsp; A measure of the same nature for all the other
Prisoners would be held equally sacred, for no Government
unquestionably would allow itself to break an Engagement of this
description.</p>
<p>If neither of these proposals is acceded to by the British
Government, there still remains another resource hitherto
solicited in vain by the Prisoners themselves, but which however
has never before been denied by any Government, to the Greatest
Criminals.&nbsp; The resource of their own Industry.&nbsp; The
ingenious but frivolous Articles manufactured by these
unfortunate Persons from the Bones which are left of their
Rations are admired.&nbsp; What advantage might they not derive
from their Industry, if they were <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>allowed to employ it upon Objects of
Trade!&nbsp; Labour would beguile the Hours of tedious Captivity
and even the Nation at whose expence they are subsisted would be
benefited by their exertions.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>We have received your Letter of the 29th of last month
relative to the present state of the French Prisoners of War in
this Country and have agreeably to your Desire, transmitted it to
the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, for their
consideration; but, at the same time, we cannot help observing
that the distressed situation which you represent the Prisoners
to be in is entirely owing either to their being totally
destitute of clothing or to their own Imprudence in disposing of
their Provisions by Gaming and not as you assert, to an
Insufficiency of the Rations of Provisions issued to them which
is fully enough to keep men living without labour, in a general
state of good health and certainly affords more subsistence than
a great part of the labouring People of this Country is able to
procure, a full pound of bread, eight ounces of fresh beef, and
above a quart of soup compounded of Vegetables or Pease for each
Man per diem.</p>
<p>We reiterated to you in our several letters of the 21st March,
24th of May, 28th of August, 11th of September, and 17th of last
month the miserable situation of the Prisoners at all the Depots
from the Want of Clothing and the melancholy consequences that
were to be expected to ensue if the French Government did not
cause them to be supplied with that necessary article previous to
the commencement of the cold weather.</p>
<p>In giving you such timely premonition we certainly did all
that was incumbent on us to do, or that Humanity dictated, and we
have no hesitation in saying that if the French Government had
expended a few thousand pounds in providing clothing for their
People in this Country in proper time the greater part of the
evils of which you now complain would not have existed.</p>
<p><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>As it
is certainly the Duty of every State to provide for the support
of its people while in Captivity, so whatever may have been its
arrangements with respect to victualling it has been the custom
in all former wars between Great Britain and France for each
Country to provide Clothing for its own Subjects and agreeably to
this Custom all the British Prisoners in France as well as the
Russian Prisoners taken in Holland, are now actually supplied
with clothing by our Agent Captain Cotes at the expence of this
Country although you state as a reason for the French Government
not clothing their people here that the British Prisoners in
France are clothed at the expence of your Government.</p>
<p>Whatever may latterly have been the effects of the prisoners
wanting clothing it cannot be denied, that until very lately, the
prisoners at all the depots were generally in as good a state of
health as at any former period even when victualled by their own
Country.&nbsp; Some indeed had fallen victims to an incurable
spirit of Gaming, by sporting away their allowance of Provisions
as well as their clothing and the Bedding with which they had
been amply supplied by us, but we believe that the number that
has suffered has hitherto not been very considerable.&nbsp; In
our letter of the 22nd April and 20th of May last we represented
to you fully the effects of this pernicuous Practise, which had
become so prevalent in the Prisons and we proposed to you a
measure which if adopted we doubt not would have greatly tended
to put a stop to it, but for what reason we know not, you have
not hitherto taken any notice to us of our communications on that
subject and from the want of your concurrence the utmost
exertions of our Agents in pursuance of our orders for
prohibiting Gaming have as yet proved ineffectual.&nbsp; While
this practise continues it is evident that if the Ration of the
Prisoners were tenfold what it is they would still sport it away,
and the circumstance of their now disposing of the Rations issued
to them is a proof that it is not on Account of the Insufficiency
of those Rations, but merely from the Gambling spirit above
mentioned, that they also dispose of their bedding and
clothing.&nbsp; Indeed, so far from their being obliged to part
with their clothing to purchase provisions it appears even from
your own Statement <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>respecting the Prisoners at Liverpool that they
actually dispose of a part of their Subsistence to procure
clothes.</p>
<p>With respect to your observation of the Prisoners not being
permitted to increase their means of Subsistence by Labour which
you say &ldquo;the most severe Administration would not refuse to
the greatest criminals&rdquo; we think it proper to acquaint you
that the prisoners at all the depots in this Country are at full
liberty to exercise their Industry within the Prisons in
manufacturing and selling any articles they may think proper
excepting hats which would effect the Revenue in opposition to
the Laws; Obscene Toys, and drawings, and articles made either
from their clothing or the Prison Stores and by means of this
privilege some of them have been known to earn and to carry off
upon their release, more than 100 guineas each.</p>
<p>Upon this occasion it has become highly expedient for us once
more solemnly to impress upon your mind the necessity of a speedy
relief being afforded to your people with respect to the article
of Clothing a supply of which would materially if not entirely
remove the principal causes of their present distress.</p>
<p>If you or rather your Government delay to furnish this supply
whatever evils may ensue and these may justly be apprehended,
cannot, after such repeated notices as we have for a long time,
given you, be imputed to this Country but to the state which in
this instance has so entirely neglected its own people.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Extract from a Report made by Commissioner Serle to the
Transport Board dated</i> 25<i>th July</i>, 1800.</p>
<p>The Prisoners complained of the smallness of the Ration but
not of the Quality supplied.&nbsp; They wished for more bread and
for beer instead of water.&nbsp; I found however that the ration
by their mode of Cookery which is left to themselves <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>is not
quite so insufficient and destitute as some of them chose to
represent it.</p>
<p>The French are generally great devourers of Bread and
therefore what would be a very competent allowance to an
Englishman appears a contracted one to them, while the meat which
an Englishman would scarcely think enough is to them a reasonable
allowance.&nbsp; The Ration of a pound of bread with half a pound
of meat Vegetables etc. digested into a Broth or soup yielding
seven quarts per diem to every six men affords a support which
our labouring poor rarely have at any time, but certainly not
during the present scarcity, and which to men living without
labour seems enough to maintain them in a general state of good
health.&nbsp; And I have been informed by some who are most
qualified to know, that the French Prisons had never had so few
sick as at the present time. <a name="citation283"></a><a
href="#footnote283" class="citation">[283]</a>&nbsp; Some indeed
who had sported away their allowance in Gambling to prevent which
the Agents have taken every precaution in their Power are in fact
destitute enough and so they might have been if their Ration had
been ten times as great.&nbsp; But this is their own fault
entirely and it cannot be expected that if a Prisoner be pleased
to throw away his food by vice, that Government must be at the
expence of supplying him again.&nbsp; However wherever this has
been discovered particularly as it may be in the Article of Bread
the whole has been seized by the agent of Officers of the Prison,
from the Winners or Purchasers and distributed amongst the
Prisoners at large.</p>
<p>Many of the Prisoners have stalls in a kind of Market within
the walls in which among other articles they sell Provisions and
vegetables and I am told acquire considerable sums of
money.&nbsp; This interior market is supplied by another without
where there is a free access of the Country People with all sorts
of provisions Beer and Produce which they are not allowed to sell
but at the fair Market Price so that Destitution is only to be
found among those few who have been weak or wicked enough to lose
their allowance by Gambling.&nbsp; I am also informed that many
Thousand pounds have been already remitted, and that sums of
money are now continually <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>remitting from France, by the
Friends of the Prisoners for additional comforts in their
situation.&nbsp; This affords a considerable supply to many of
their requirements.</p>
<p>Their clothing in general for which the French Government has
ceased to provide (as well as for the victualling) is getting
very bad, and to meet the winter fairly must by some means or
other be supplied.</p>
<p>Besides the remittances from France, the Prisoners are allowed
to sell any kinds of their own manufactures; Straw Hats (which
would interfere with the Revenue) and Articles made from Stores
excepted, by which means some have been known to earn and to
carry off on their Release more than a Hundred Guineas
each.&nbsp; This with an open Market as above mentioned operates
much to their advantage and Comfort and they show their
satisfaction in the Habits of Cheerfulness peculiar to
themselves.&nbsp; The Prisoners have free access to the several
Apartments from the opening of the Prison in the morning until
they are shut up on the approach of night with the exception only
of the times when they are fumigating or cleansing for the
preservation of Health.&nbsp; Six Prisoners chosen by the body at
large have access to the Cook rooms every morning when the
Provisions are brought in that they may witness to their full
weight and object to any deficiency.</p>
<p>In case of sickness the patients are immediately removed under
the direction of the Medical people, to the Hospital and supplied
with the necessary assistance.</p>
<p>Nothing can exceed the cleanliness and decency of the
Hospitals.</p>

<p><i>The Commissary of the French Republic in England</i>, <i>to
the Commissioners of the Transport Office</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>
<p>I have just received the honour of your letter of the 1st of
November in answer to mine of the 29th October.&nbsp; I shall
immediately communicate it to my Government.</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>In
making mention of the deplorable situation to which the Prisoners
are reduced you appear to think that I have given no answer to
the Communications you made to me respecting the very censurable
practise of such of them as risk the loss of their Rations in
Gambling.&nbsp; I request that you will refer to my letter of the
2nd of May in which you will find the following Paragraph.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I entirely approve of the Punishment you propose to
inflict upon those who according to the information you have sent
me, deal in Provisions; and I beg that you will communicate to me
a list of the Persons guilty of this conduct.&nbsp; It even
appears necessary in order that the Punishment may be the more
felt, to separate them from their comrades and to collect them in
a Depot for this purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have written to the
Secretaries at the different Depots to the above effect, and I
Have procured authority from the Minister to treat with the
utmost severity those who made a traffic of the Rations of their
comrades.&nbsp; I have done in this respect every thing my
situation will admit of my doing, but until I shall know, who are
the guilty it will be impossible for me to punish them.</p>

&agrave; mon secours sur ma premi&egrave;re demande et sans que

j&rsquo;aurois craint de blesser votre

tout &agrave; la fois &eacute;t&eacute;
p&eacute;n&eacute;tr&eacute; de respect et de confiance.&nbsp; Je
ne puis vous dire ce que j&rsquo;ai &eacute;prouv&eacute;, il
n&rsquo;appartient qu&rsquo;&agrave; un c&oelig;ur tel que le
v&ocirc;tre de pouvoir le juger: j&rsquo;ai tout
perdu&mdash;fortune&mdash;amis&mdash;famille.&nbsp; Il ne me
reste que l&rsquo;honneur, en vous j&rsquo;ai cru tout
retrouver.&nbsp; Pardonn&eacute;s, Mylord, cet exc&egrave;s de
franchise et de libert&eacute;, je joins ici une note dont je
vous supplie de faire lecture; daign&eacute;s y donner
quelqu&rsquo; attention; elle est tout &agrave; la fois importune
et indiscrette, mais elle ne sauroit vous blesser.&nbsp; Le
malheur a des droits sur une &acirc;me aussi grande et aussi
&eacute;lev&eacute;e que la v&ocirc;tre, et elle pardonne
l&rsquo;importunit&eacute; et l&rsquo;indiscr&eacute;tion.&nbsp;
La gr&acirc;ce que j&rsquo;implore de vous par dessus toutes les

<p>To express to you how much I have been touched by your
goodness, and by the reception you have given me, would be
impossible.&nbsp; Permit me to offer you the just homage of my
acknowledgement.&nbsp; For almost twenty years all sorts of
misfortune have not ceased to overwhelm me, and I venture to say,
that it is to you alone that I am indebted for having been able
to forget them for an instant, and during these twenty years, the
hours that I have passed at Milton are the happiest that I am
able to count up.&nbsp; This is neither a compliment nor phrase,
the heart alone speaks in this moment, and it is the only homage
which can please you, and which is worthy of you.&nbsp; I have
never dared to speak to you, my lord, of all the sentiments that
have made me feel the goodness and the nobleness with which you
have deigned to come to my help on my first request, and if I had
not had the honour of being known to you I should have feared to
wound your delicacy; I have dared still less to acquaint you with
all the misfortune of my actual position, but I confess to you,
my lord, that on seeing you I was at once filled with respect and
with confidence.&nbsp; I cannot tell you what I have felt, it
only belongs to a nature such as yours to be able to judge; I
have lost all, fortune, friends, family&mdash;my honour only
remains.&nbsp; In you I have believed to find all
again&mdash;pardon, my lord, this excess of frankness and
freedom.&nbsp; I enclose a note which I beg you to read, please
give it some attention.&nbsp; <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>It is both importunate and
indiscreet&mdash;but I am sure it will not hurt your
feelings.&nbsp; Misfortune has claims upon a soul as great and as
noble as yours, and it will pardon the importunity and
indiscretion.&nbsp; The favour which I implore of you, above all
others, my lord, is, that this note may not be taken amiss by
you; whether you deign to have any regard for it, or whether you
reject it, pray do not deprive me of your goodness; although I
have no right to lay claim to it, permit me to hope that the
excess of liberty that I dare to take will not deprive me of
it.&nbsp; Everything with you and in you has convinced me that I
have found a father and a benefactor.</p>

parti de France en 1791, avec tr&egrave;s peu de moyens, a
pass&eacute; en Italie.&nbsp; Ass&eacute;s heureux pour obtenir
la place de premier Aum&ocirc;nier de Mde. Victoire de France,
c&rsquo;est aux bont&eacute;s de cette auguste Princesse
qu&rsquo;il a d&ucirc; son existence.&nbsp; A sa mort
arriv&eacute;e en 1799, il s&rsquo;est vu priv&eacute; de toutes
ressources.&nbsp; A cette &eacute;poque, il a pass&eacute; en
Angleterre, o&ugrave; il a obtenu le traitement fix&eacute; pour
les Ev&ecirc;ques, qui &eacute;tait alors de &pound;10 par
mois.&nbsp; Il s&rsquo;est &eacute;tabli &agrave; Londres
ch&eacute;s M. de Pontcarr&eacute;, ancien Premier
Pr&eacute;sident du Parlement de Rouen, qui avoit
&eacute;pous&eacute; sa s&oelig;ur en premi&egrave;res noces,
dont il a en deux enfans; il ne connoissoit point le malheureux
&eacute;tat des affaires de cette famille.&nbsp; Son c&oelig;ur
et le d&eacute;sir de l&rsquo;obliger, l&rsquo;ont
entra&iacute;n&eacute; fort au del&agrave; de ce que ses moyens
lui permettoient de faire.&nbsp; Il ne eraint pas sur cela
d&rsquo;avouer ses torts, et de dire que pour soutenir cette
malheureuse famille, il a &eacute;t&eacute; jusqu&rsquo;&agrave;
se mettre en avant pour plus de &pound;1600, d&rsquo;apr&egrave;s
les promesses qui lui &eacute;toient faites d&rsquo;un <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>remboursement prochain.&nbsp; Son p&egrave;re vivoit
alors, et il avoit lieu de croire qu&rsquo;il pourroit en
esp&eacute;rer quelques ressources.&nbsp; Son neveu et sa
ni&egrave;ce &eacute;toient en France, et il avoit quelque droit
d&rsquo;esp&eacute;rer qu&rsquo;ils auroient &eacute;gard
&agrave; ce qu&rsquo;il faisoit pour aider leur p&egrave;re et sa
famille.&nbsp; Il ne pr&eacute;tend point diminuer ses torts,
mais sur ces esp&eacute;rances, il s&rsquo;est laiss&eacute;
aller &agrave; la facilit&eacute; de son caraet&egrave;re, et
n&rsquo;ayant par lui-m&ecirc;me aucuns moyens, a
contract&eacute; divers engagements dont il est aujourd&rsquo;hui
la victime.&nbsp; Son p&egrave;re est mort en 1802 sans avoir
fait aucunes dispositions; on l&rsquo;a frustr&eacute; de tout ce
qu&rsquo;il pouvoit pr&eacute;tendre, et un fr&egrave;re
qu&rsquo;il a encore en France, ainsi que son neveu et sa
ni&egrave;ce se sont empar&eacute;s de la succession sans lui en
rendre aucun compte.&nbsp; M. d&rsquo;Aligre, son cousin germain,
&agrave; qui il a rendu le service de contribuer &agrave; lui
conserver trois millions qu&rsquo;il avoit sur la banque
d&rsquo;Angleterre, est venu &agrave; Londres pour recueillir
cette somme, et lui a promis alors de lui pr&ecirc;ter 12,000f.
de France sous le cautionnement de son neveu et de sa
ni&egrave;ce, et lui en a m&ecirc;me donn&eacute; parole.&nbsp;
La caution a &eacute;t&eacute; promise, et de retour en France,
M. d&rsquo;Aligre ainsi que les autres n&rsquo;ont tenu nul
compte de leurs promesses.&nbsp; Il peut dire avoir
&eacute;prouv&eacute; sous tous les rapports tous les genres de
proc&eacute;d&eacute;s les plus injustes et les moins
d&eacute;licats.&nbsp; On a &eacute;t&eacute;
jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; lui faire entrevoir qu&rsquo;on ne penseroit
&agrave; le secourir, qu&rsquo;autant qu&rsquo;il retournerait en
France, et qu&rsquo;il se soumettroit au gouvernement qui y
domine, ce qu&rsquo;il ne fera jamais, quelque malheureux
qu&rsquo;il puisse &ecirc;tre.&nbsp; Il y a donc bient&ocirc;t 9
ans que l&rsquo;&eacute;v&ecirc;que de Moulins g&eacute;mit sous
le poids du malheur, et que ses jours ne sont compt&eacute;s que
par ses peines; ce n&rsquo;est que par des engagemens nouveaux
qu&rsquo;il a pu satisfaire aux plus anciens, et ses embarras,
par cons&eacute;quent, loin de diminuer, n&rsquo;ont fait
qu&rsquo;augmenter.&nbsp; Il ose avouer que dans le nombre de ses
dettes, il y a une de &pound;200 pour laquelle il paye &pound;60
d&rsquo;int&eacute;r&ecirc;t par an.&nbsp; Il a tout perdu: rien
ne lui reste en France, puisque d&rsquo;une part le gouvernement,
et de l&rsquo;autre, sa famille lui ont tout enlev&eacute; il ne
lui reste uniquement pour vivre que les &pound;20 qu&rsquo;il
re&ccedil;oit par mois de la g&eacute;n&eacute;rosit&eacute; du
gouvernement Britannique.&nbsp; Il commence &agrave; avancer en
&acirc;ge; il est affreux pour lui de penser &agrave;
l&rsquo;avenir.&nbsp; Il ne connoit personne en Angleterre,
n&rsquo;y a ni appui, ni soutien.&nbsp; Sa seule ressource
&eacute;toit pour s&rsquo;assurer une existence <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>tranquille
de trouver une somme de &pound;1000 sterlings &agrave; emprunter,
et n&rsquo;ayant point d&rsquo;autre assurance &agrave; donner,
il a offert de faire assurer sa vie pour cette somme, et de
donner les s&ucirc;ret&eacute;s n&eacute;cessaires pour le
pavement des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts, et pour
l&rsquo;int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de l&rsquo;assurance.&nbsp; Par ce
moyen on seroit s&ucirc;r &agrave; sa mort de ne rien
perdre.&nbsp; Il y a plus de deux ans qu&rsquo;il cherche ce
moyen de se lib&eacute;rer sans avoir pu y r&eacute;ussir.&nbsp;
La somme de &pound;200 pour laquelle il paye &pound;60
d&rsquo;int&eacute;r&ecirc;t par an est assur&eacute;e au bureau
d&rsquo;assurance.&nbsp; Telle est la position exacte dans
laquelle se trouve l&rsquo;Ev&ecirc;que de Moulins, sans cesse
expos&eacute; &agrave; des embarras, &agrave; des
inqui&eacute;tudes, et menant par cons&eacute;quent la vie la
plus p&eacute;nible et la plus malheureuse.&nbsp; Tels sont les
faits dans la plus exacte v&eacute;rit&eacute;, qu&rsquo;il ose
exposer &agrave; Milord Fitzwilliam.&nbsp; C&rsquo;est dans ces
circonstances, qu&rsquo;il vient se jeter entre ses bras, et
implorer, il ne craint pas de se servir de ce terme
vis-&agrave;-vis d&rsquo;un homme tel que lui, non pas seulement
ses bont&eacute;s, mais sa piti&eacute;,&mdash;si Mylord par
quelques moyens peut all&eacute;ger sa malheureuse situation, il
rendra en quelque mani&egrave;re la vie et l&rsquo;existence
&agrave; un homme qui ne se croit pas indigne de son estime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bishop of Moulins, who left
France in 1791, with very small means, went into Italy and was
fortunate enough to obtain the post of first Chaplain to Madame
Victoire of France.&nbsp; It is to the bounty of this august
princess that he owed his existence.&nbsp; At her death, which
took place in 1799, he found himself deprived of all his
resources.&nbsp; At this period he went to England, where he got
the salary fixed for Bishops, which was then &pound;10 a
month.&nbsp; He settled down in London in the house of M.
Pontcarr&eacute;, the former First President of the Parliament of
Rouen, whose first wife was the Bishop&rsquo;s sister; by her M.
Pontcarr&eacute; had two children.&nbsp; He had no idea of the
unhappy state of affairs in this family.&nbsp; His kindness of
heart and his wish to help them involved him far beyond what his
means allowed him to do.&nbsp; He is not afraid of confessing
that in that he did wrong, and of saying that to support that
unhappy family he went so far as to advance &pound;1,600 on the
strength of the promises which <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>had been made to him of an early
repayment.&nbsp; His father was still living, and he had cause to
believe that he might hope for some resources from him.&nbsp; His
nephew and niece were in France, and he had some right to hope
that they would be mindful of what he was doing to help their
father and his family.&nbsp; He did not attempt to minimise his
fault, but because of this hope he gave way to the weakness of
his character, and, not having any means himself, contracted
various bonds of which he is now the victim.&nbsp; His father
died in 1802 without having made any provision; he was defrauded
of all to which he could lay a claim, and a brother who was still
in France, as well as his nephew and his niece, took possession
of the inheritance without taking him into consideration.&nbsp;
M. d&rsquo;Aligre, his first cousin, to whom he had done a
service by contributing to keep for him three million which he
had in the Bank of England, came to London to collect that sum,
and promised him then to lend him 12,000 francs (of France) on
the security of his nephew and niece, and even gave his word for
it.&nbsp; The security was promised.&nbsp; On his return to
France neither M. d&rsquo;Aligre nor the others kept their
promise.&nbsp; He may be said to have had to endure during this
time the most unjust and indelicate behaviour.&nbsp; They even
went so far as to hint to him that they could not help him,
unless he returned to France and submitted himself to her
government that was then ruling, a thing which he would never do,
however unfortunate he might be.&nbsp; It is now nearly nine
years that the Bishop of Moulins has groaned under the load of
his misfortune.&nbsp; His days could only be counted by his
struggles, and it was only by fresh bonds that he was able to
satisfy the older ones, and his embarrassments consequently, far
from diminishing, only increased.&nbsp; He dares to confess that
amongst his debts there is one of &pound;200 for which he pays
&pound;60 interest per annum.&nbsp; He has lost everything,
nothing remains to him in France, as the government on one side
and his family on the other have taken everything from him.&nbsp;
There only remains for him to live on the &pound;20 which he
receives every month through the generosity of the British
Government.&nbsp; He is beginning to advance in age, and it is
terrible for him to think of the future.&nbsp; He knows no one in
England who can help or <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>support him.&nbsp; His only resource
was, to make sure of a quiet existence, to find the sum of
&pound;1,000 sterling to borrow, and having no other assurance to
give, he offered to have his life insured for that sum, and to
give the sureties necessary for the payment of the interests and
for the interest of the insurance.&nbsp; By these means they
would be sure of losing nothing at his death.&nbsp; For more than
two years he has been trying to get himself out of debt by this
means, but has not succeeded.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;200, for
which he pays &pound;60 interest per annum, is insured at the
Insurance Office.&nbsp; This is the position the Bishop of
Moulins finds himself in, always exposed to embarrassments and
anxiety, and consequently leading a most difficult and unhappy
life.&nbsp; These are the exact facts, which he ventures to
confide to Lord Fitzwilliam.&nbsp; It is under these
circumstances that he throws himself on his mercy and craves, he
is not afraid of using such a word to such a man, not only his
favour, but his pity.&nbsp; If his Lordship can by some means
alleviate this unhappy situation, he will in some manner give
back life and existence to a man who does not believe himself
unworthy of his esteem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the receipt of the story of
your life which you have done me the honour to confide in me, I
have been devoting myself to looking into my own private means, a
very necessary preliminary step in the circumstances in which I
find myself at the present moment, having had to pay the expenses
of the election of my son, a transaction which has cost me hardly
less than &pound;100,000 sterling.&nbsp; After this avowal,
Monseigneur, you will see that I must be left with very narrowed
means.&nbsp; In the meantime, perceiving clearly, Monseigneur,
the embarrassing state of your affairs, and touched with the
desire to relieve them to the extent which my circumstances can
furnish, and considering that the interest of &pound;60 per
annum, that you pay for the loan of &pound;200, must weigh
heavily upon you, I have the honour to offer you the amount to
free you from that charge.&nbsp; As to the rest, I am in despair
that I can go no further, perceiving well that the embarrassing
position in which you find yourself arises from circumstances
which you could not have avoided and from a conduct which
ennobles your character, being the result of a patriotic
uprightness, too pure and too sincere to seek favour and
protection from the impious hands of usurpation.</p>

<p>The fresh bounties with which you deign to overwhelm me fill
me with a gratitude which it is impossible for me to express, but
if I dare say so, it is again, less, the kindnesses, in their
relation to the comfort and help they have given me, which make
me feel all that an upright and sensitive nature should feel,
than the letter which you have done me the honour to write.</p>
<p>All that I feared was to displease you, by my importunity and
indiscretion, but the amiable and obliging manner in which under
all circumstances you have deigned to reply to me, has made me
experience a satisfaction, of which only a heart like yours can
judge.&nbsp; If you had been able to <a name="page301"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 301</span>see what passed within me when
reading it, I feel sure that you, thinking as you do, would have
had real pleasure, and by putting me, through your gifts, in a
position to free myself of this heavy debt of &pound;200 which I
have contracted, you have relieved me far beyond my expectations,
and made it possible for me to enjoy much more peace and ease of
mind&mdash;and what will add to it still more, is the fact of my
being indebted to you.&nbsp; There still remains one more
request, my lord, and that is to allow me to go and see you some
day, and tell you in person all that I feel.</p>
<p>I have taken the liberty, my lord, of telling you all that
passed between the Transport Office and me, about the young
prisoner, whom they allotted to me, as servant, and of whom they
deprived me, by sending him back to prison.&nbsp; My
circumstances are known to you, and therefore it is easy for you
to judge that they will not allow me an expensive servant, such
as are the English ones, moreover, I do not speak the English
language well enough to be served by one of these, and yet the
unfortunate state of my health and a sort of propriety do not
allow me to have any servants.&nbsp; I have recourse to your
protection, my lord, and, if by what you deign to give me, and
the interest which you have the goodness to take in me, it were
in your power to have awarded to me, either by the Admiralty
principally, or by the Transport Office, I might hope, not for
the young man whom they allowed me before, and whom I do not ask
back for private reasons, but for him whom I asked in his place,
called Sebastian Sequelleux, a cabin boy, taken on board the
<i>Marie Fran&ccedil;oise</i>, aged about fifteen years, under
the same conditions as the first whose passport I enclose,
begging you not to give it up, but to keep it in your own hands,
because it may be useful to me&mdash;a passport which will
justify you that they had not the right to take him back again,
nor to act in the manner towards me that they have done&mdash;I
should be under a real obligation to you.</p>
<p>Since I had the honour of seeing you I have suffered much from
vomiting of blood, to which I am subject, it is very hard and
very trying for me, under these circumstances, <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>to have no
one near me.&nbsp; If I hazard this request, my lord, it is your
kindness alone, which inspires this confidence, and I implore you
to consider it null and void, if you see the least
difficulty&mdash;and if it should compromise you in the
least.&nbsp; If I can have the young man that I ask for, it is to
you alone that I wish to be indebted, and to you alone that he
will be granted, so that the Transport Office can see in all
that, only the interest you have deigned to take in me.&nbsp;
Forgive so much liberty, so much importunity&mdash;but an honest
and unhappy Frenchman, who has the happiness to see you, finds in
you his prop and stay.</p>

19<i>th March</i> 1808.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>In answer to what is stated in Lord Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s letter
to Lord Mulgrave, I request you will inform his Lordship that the
Bishop of Moulins was introduced to me by the Bishop of
Montpellier, and at his request I prevailed on my colleagues to
release a Prisoner of War from Norman Cross Prison to attend upon
him; this, I am sorry to acknowledge, was irregular and
unauthorised, but I was actuated by motives of humanity, as the
Bishop complained that his finances were so limited that he could
not afford to keep any servant of a different description.&nbsp;
This should have influenced the Bishop to keep his servant from
carrying on any improper traffic with the Prisoners; on the
contrary he became the instrument of introducing straw,
manufactured, <a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>to the Prisoners for the purpose of being made into
hats, bonnets, etc., by which the Revenue of our country is
injured, and the poor who exist by that branch of trade would be
turned out of employ, as the prisoners who are fed, clothed, and
lodged at the public expense would be able to undersell them.</p>
<p>I must observe that this is the only article which the
Prisoners are prevented from manufacturing.</p>
<p>When the Bishop&rsquo;s servant had established himself in
this trade the Bishop wrote to me, that he had found means of
getting his livelihood, and desired he might remain at large, and
that another prisoner might be released to serve him, neither of
which the Board thought proper to comply with, for the foregoing
reasons; upon which the Bishop of Moulins complained to the
Admiralty, who directed us to give such answer as the case called
for.</p>
<p>I have only to add that the Bishop experienced greater
indulgence from us than any other French Ecclesiastick ever did,
to which in my opinion he has not made an adequate return, nor
felt himself, as he ought to have done, answerable for the
conduct of his servant; and if a strict discipline is not
maintained in the Prisons as the Prisoners are daily increasing,
the consequences may be incalculable.</p>

consolations, plong&eacute; dans le malheur depuis pr&egrave;s de
vingt ans, la providence m&rsquo;a conduit &agrave; Stilton pour

esp&eacute;rer, sans aucun m&eacute;rite, sans aucun titre,
aupr&egrave;s de vous, vous seul av&eacute;s daign&eacute; me
servir de consolation, d&rsquo;appui, et me procurer des secours,
que je n&rsquo;aurois jamais cru devoir attendre.&nbsp; Il
n&rsquo;est ici question ni de phrases, ni de tournures

Vous av&eacute;s la bont&eacute; de vous int&eacute;resser
&agrave; ma sant&eacute;: elle a &eacute;t&eacute; bien
mis&eacute;rable depuis que je n&rsquo;ai eu l&rsquo;honneur de
vous voir, les accidents de sang auxquels je suis sujet
m&rsquo;ont fort fatigu&eacute;; ces deux derniers jours-ei
j&rsquo;ai &eacute;t&eacute; extr&ecirc;mement souffrant, comme
depuis longues ann&eacute;es, je suis accoutum&eacute; &agrave;
souffrir, cela ne m&rsquo;emp&ecirc;che pas de continuer ma
besogne comme &agrave; l&rsquo;ordinaire, et bien certainement,
cela ne m&rsquo;emp&ecirc;chera pas de profiter de vos
bont&eacute;s, et de vous aller faire ma cour &agrave; Milton, le
jour que vous m&rsquo;indiquer&eacute;s; le d&eacute;sir que
Monsieur votre fils veut bien avoir de faire connaissance avec
moi me flatte au del&agrave; de tout ce que je puis vous
exprimer, et il sera bien heureux pour moi d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre
&agrave; port&eacute;e en lui rendant mes hommages de lui
exprimer tout ce que je sens et tout ce dont je suis redevable au
p&egrave;re qu&rsquo;il a le bonheur <a name="page305"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 305</span>d&rsquo;avoir, et qui en est devenu
un pour moi.&nbsp; A l&rsquo;exception des dimanches, et du jeudi
et du vendredi de la Semaine Sainte, c&rsquo;est &agrave; dire de
celle qui pr&eacute;c&egrave;de la f&ecirc;te de P&acirc;ques,
tous les jours, o&ugrave; vous daigneri&eacute;s me proposer de
venir &agrave; Milton seront libres pour moi, parce que je puis
m&rsquo;arranger pour que vers les trois heures ou trois heures
et demie apr&egrave;s je puisse &ecirc;tre libre.</p>
<p>Je ne saurois vous dire, Milord, combien je suis touch&eacute;
de toutes les d&eacute;marches que vous av&eacute;s eu la
bont&eacute; de faire pour me procurer un jeune prisonnier pour
me servir de domestique, ce que j&rsquo;ai souffert dans ces
derniers temps m&rsquo;a encore plus prouv&eacute; combien il
&eacute;toit n&eacute;cessaire d&rsquo;avoir aupr&egrave;s de moi
quelqu&rsquo;un pour me servir.&nbsp; Je d&eacute;sire bien que
les d&eacute;marches que vous av&eacute;s daign&eacute; faire ne
soient pas sans succ&egrave;s, c&rsquo;est &agrave; vous, si la
chose r&eacute;ussit que j&rsquo;en serai uniquement redevable,
et d&egrave;s lors j&rsquo;en sentirai doublement le poids.&nbsp;
J&rsquo;ose dire qu&rsquo;il y avoit une v&eacute;ritable
injustice &agrave; m&rsquo;en refuser un, car,
ind&eacute;pendamment de ce qu&rsquo;on n&rsquo;avoit pas le
droit &agrave; ce que je crois, de m&rsquo;&ocirc;ter celui qui
j&rsquo;avois d&rsquo;apr&egrave;s le passeport qui avoit
&eacute;t&eacute; donne, je puis certifier que les raisons
qu&rsquo;on a mises en avance pour le faire rentrer dans la
prison, et surtout celle qu&rsquo;on a all&eacute;gu&eacute;es
d&rsquo;avoir introduit de la paille dans les prisons, est
d&eacute;nu&eacute;e de toute v&eacute;rit&eacute;, et &agrave;
l&rsquo;&eacute;gard de cette derni&egrave;re raison qui
n&rsquo;est aujourd&rsquo;hui mise en avant que pour la
premi&egrave;re fois, je crois pouvoir r&eacute;pondre que
l&rsquo;accusation est absolument fausse.&nbsp; Mais comme je ne
reviens pas sur le pass&eacute; si l&rsquo;on m&rsquo;en accorde
un autre par votre protection, j&rsquo;en aurois une vraie
satisfaction, car je suis r&eacute;ellement malheureux, dans la
position o&ugrave; je me trouve, de n&rsquo;avoir personne pour
me servir.</p>
<p>Vous av&eacute;s la bont&eacute; de me dire, Milord, que
lorsque j&rsquo;aurai fait mes arrangements pour liquider la
somme de &pound;200, vous voudr&eacute;s bien me faire
transmettre cette somme de la mani&egrave;re qui me sera la plue
commode.&nbsp; Comme de raison ce sera &agrave;
l&rsquo;&eacute;poque qui vous sera la plus convenable, ce que
vous faites pour moi, est trop au del&agrave; de tout ce que je
pouvois jamais esp&eacute;rer, pour que le terme qui vous sera le
plus agr&eacute;able ne soit le mien.</p>
<p>A la v&eacute;rit&eacute; plut&ocirc;t je pourrai &ecirc;tre
lib&eacute;r&eacute; de cette dette, plut&ocirc;t ce sera le
mieux pour moi.&nbsp; Et puisque vous me <a

vous convient, je prendrai la libert&eacute; de vous observer que
comme dans ce moment-ci il nous est d&ucirc; quatre mois de notre
traitement, ce qui ne laisse pas pour l&rsquo;instant de rendre
la position un peu embarrassante, si vous daigni&eacute;s me
faire passer ici 100 livres sterlings en papiers du pays, ou en
papiers de la banque d&rsquo;Angleterre, et un draft de 100
livres sterlings sur votre banquier &agrave; Londres, alors je
laisserois les 4 mois qui avec celui qui sera d&ucirc; au premier
mai feroient la somme de &pound;100 pour compl&eacute;ter les
&pound;200, et ce que vous auri&eacute;s la bont&eacute; de
m&rsquo;envoyer ici, me serviroit &agrave; ma d&eacute;pense
habituelle et n&eacute;cessaire.&nbsp; Pardonn&eacute;s ma
franchise et ma libert&eacute;, vos bont&eacute;s seules
m&rsquo;y autorisent, mais d&rsquo;ailleurs, ce qui vous
conviendra le mieux &agrave; cet &eacute;gard, fera toujours mon
arrangement.&nbsp; Pou-vois-je jamais esp&eacute;rer tant de
bont&eacute; de quelqu&rsquo;un dont je n&rsquo;avois pas
seulement l&rsquo;honneur d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre connu.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>
<p>It is of the nature of your generous and kind soul to
understand all that I feel.&nbsp; Deprived of all help and all
consolation, plunged in the depths of misery for almost twenty
years, Providence led me to Stilton to find in you what I had
never dared to hope for without any merits, without any
title.&nbsp; Near you, you alone deigned to give me comfort,
support, and have secured me the help which I should never have
dared to hope for.&nbsp; There is no language in which I can tell
you what I feel.&nbsp; If you could only read into my heart you
would see there all that it feels and with what gratitude it is
filled.&nbsp; You have the kindness to show interest in my
health.&nbsp; It has been very wretched since I <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>last had
the honour of seeing you.&nbsp; The blood complaint to which I am
subject has exhausted me very much, and these last two days I
have suffered a great deal; but as I have been used to suffering
for many years, it does not prevent me from going about as usual,
and it certainly will not stop me from profiting by your kindness
to go and pay my respects to you at Milton the day which you
name.&nbsp; The desire that your son has to make my acquaintance
flatters me more than I can say, and it will give me great
pleasure to pay my respects to him, and to express to him all
that I feel and how indebted I am to the father whom he has the
happiness to possess and who has become such for me.&nbsp; With
the exception of Sundays, Thursday and Friday in Holy Week, that
is to say that which precedes Eastertide, any day which you
propose to me for coming to Milton will be free for me, for I can
arrange to be free at about three or half-past three
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; I cannot tell you, my lord,
how much I have been touched by the steps you have taken in
trying to procure me a young prisoner to act as my servant.&nbsp;
What I have suffered lately has proved to me still more how
necessary it was to have somebody to wait on me.&nbsp; I hope
very much that the steps which you have so kindly taken will not
be without success, and it is to you only, if the affair proves
successful, that I shall be indebted, and from then onwards I
shall be doubly grateful.&nbsp; I take the liberty to say, that
it was a real injustice to refuse me one, because, independently
of the fact that they have not the right as far as I can make
out, to take away the one I had, according to the passport which
had been given to him, I can certify that the reasons they put
forward for sending him back to prison, and especially that of
his alleged taking of straw into the prison, is devoid of all
truth; and with regard to this last reason, which to-day has been
advanced for the first time, I believe that I can take upon
myself to answer that the accusation is absolutely false; but as
I do not wish to rake up the past, if I am granted another under
your protection, I shall have a real satisfaction, for I am
really miserable in the position in which I find myself, without
anyone to wait upon me.&nbsp; You had the goodness to tell me, my
lord, that when I <a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>had made my arrangements to pay off the sum of
&pound;200, you would forward me that sum in the manner which
would be most convenient to me.&nbsp; Of course that would be at
the time most convenient to you.&nbsp; That which you are doing
for me is far beyond all that I could ever have hoped, and so the
date which is most agreeable to you will be mine too.&nbsp;
Indeed, the sooner I shall be freed from that debt the sooner my
position will improve.&nbsp; And as you allow me to speak to you
candidly, if it is convenient to you, I take the liberty of
pointing out to you that four months of my salary is owing to me
at the present time, which does not make the position less
embarrassing at present.&nbsp; If you will deign to send me here
&pound;100 sterling in notes or in English bank-notes and a draft
of &pound;100 on your bank in London, then I would lay aside the
four months&rsquo; salary, which, together with that which I
ought to receive on the first of May, would make the sum of
&pound;100 to complete the &pound;200, and what you will have the
goodness to send to me here will serve me for my usual and
necessary expenses.&nbsp; Pardon my frankness and the liberty;
your kindness alone authorises me, but after all, whatever suits
you best in this matter will suit me also.&nbsp; Could I ever
have hoped for so much kindness from someone I had not even the
honour of knowing?</p>
<p>I have the honour to be with respect, allow me to add with a
gratitude which will last all my life.</p>

<p>The earnest interest which your Lordship takes in the Request
of the Bishop of Moulins could not fail to determine <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>me to make
further enquiry respecting that person, from Sir Rupert
George:&mdash;From him I learn, that in point of fact the Bishop
of Moulins was only designated as such, and has not, in addition
to his other sacrifices, to lament the splendour of a
Bishop&rsquo;s establishment.&nbsp; The allowance of a servant
from amongst the Prisoners was a particular indulgence to the
Bishop of Moulins, which has in no instance been extended to any
other person, and could not indeed, from the general conduct of
the French Prisoners, be admitted as a general practice; under
all these circumstances the Bishop of Moulins has certainly not
conducted himself with the discretion and propriety which might
have been expected from him.&nbsp; But if I can have the pledge
of your Lordship&rsquo;s assurance that the Bishop of Moulins
will not again abuse the indulgence of Government, as a mark of
respect to your Lordship I will certainly give directions that a
servant shall be again allowed to that Prelate, from amongst the
Prisoners.</p>

which, already in its fourth year, this war had imposed upon the
nation, the following extract from the report furnished to the
Transport Office, by Captain Woodriff, R.N., agent to the
Commissioners, of the average price of provisions and the rate of
wages in the district in which the Depot had been established,
during the time that the prison and barracks were erecting, may
be of interest.&nbsp; Mutton was 10&frac12;<i>d.</i> per lb.,
beef 1<i>s.</i> per lb., bread 1s. per quartern loaf.&nbsp;
Carpenters&rsquo; wages were 12s. per week, shoemakers&rsquo;
10<i>s.</i>, bakers&rsquo; 9<i>s.</i>, blacksmiths&rsquo;
8<i>s.</i>, and husbandmen 7<i>s.</i>&nbsp; Starvation wages were
then a literal truth.&nbsp; Four years later from a Parliamentary
Report we find the Government granting a bounty on all imported
wheat, in order to keep the price down to &pound;5 a quarter,
other grain being treated in the same way.&nbsp; We can well
understand that, as the price of provisions went up, and the
taxation increased with the prolongation of the war (a war which,
however it originated, was prolonged for years by the ambitious
projects of Buonaparte for the aggrandisement of himself and of
France), the animosity not only of the actual combatants, but
also of the suffering men, women, and children, steadily grew
against the man and the nation whom they regarded as the authors
of all their misery.</p>

Register of Marriages in St. John&rsquo;s Church, Peterborough,
probably explains the reason for the housing of the surgeon in a
comfortable brick house within those prison walls, instead of in
the very indifferent quarters in the hospital casern:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;October 18th, 1808, George H. Walker of
Yaxley to Elizabeth Colinette Pressland of St.
John&rsquo;s.&mdash;Witnesses: Thomas Pressland, Thomas Alderson
Cook, James Gibbs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. George H. Walker was the surgeon to the Prison, which was
in the Parish of Yaxley, and Captain Pressland, R.N., had been
for some years, after the renewal of the war in 1803,
Superintendent of the Prison, so among all these dry details
crops up the picture of our human life.&nbsp; We see the young
medical officer passing through the door in the Prison wall which
communicated with the Superintendent&rsquo;s house (the door over
which the wall is seen rising with a ramp in the photographs of
the only fragments of the wall now remaining) to spend happy
hours with Captain Pressland&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; We see
friendship ripening into love, the story told by the entry in the
Register of St. John&rsquo;s Church, Peterborough, and then in
the Register of St. Peter&rsquo;s, Yaxley, we are brought face to
face with a tragedy, for the last entry of a burial from the
Depot is &ldquo;Captain Thomas Pressland, Norman Cross.&nbsp;
March 21st, 1814.&nbsp; 59 years.&nbsp; Signed, J. Hinde,
Curate,&rdquo; and there can be little doubt that from the house
to which, mainly through his future father-in-law&rsquo;s
influence, Surgeon Walker was able in the third year of its
existence to bring Elizabeth Colinette Pressland as his bride,
while the bells of Yaxley Church rang out a merry marriage peal,
six years later passed the body of Captain Pressland himself to
be laid in Yaxley Churchyard, while the death bell tolled its
solemn note.&nbsp; For six years this house was the house of the
couple for whom it was built.&nbsp; It was in the
auctioneer&rsquo;s catalogue, when it was sold on the 2nd October
1810, nothing more than &ldquo;An excellent brick dwelling-house,
containing a cellar 12 ft. 6 in. by 11 ft. 2 in., parlour 13 ft.
3 in. by 13 ft. 8 in., etc., etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; To us, 100 years
later, it is a part of the great tragedy of Norman Cross, and by
the light of the registers we see it in those short eight years
from its building to its destruction the scone of the brightest
joys and the deepest griefs of men and women whose names we know,
whose persons we can imagine, and who help to clothe those cold,
dry records with the warmth of human life.</p>

as to the appearance of the barracks and prison which I was able
to obtain in 1891, was from an old Mr. Lewin of Yaxley, who was

childhood.&nbsp; He used frequently to ride in through this west
gate in the tradesmen&rsquo;s carts, but he spoke always of the
entrance on the south front as the main entrance.&nbsp; This old

Peterborough is preserved the Register, kept by the resident
Priest at King&rsquo;s Cliff, of the baptisms performed by
priests within the mission of his church.&nbsp; Stilton, the
Depot, and the surrounding villages were within that
district.&nbsp; Two of the entries are baptisms of the sons of
Delapoux; they will be referred to in a future chapter.&nbsp;
They have always been supposed to be those of the baptism of the
children of a French prisoner, who had married an English wife
(these marriages were of rare occurrence), and the discovery in
the Record Office of this entry of John Andrew Delapoux&rsquo;s
appointment as a clerk is an instance of the way in which
research upsets old traditions.&nbsp; I find the entry of
Delapoux&rsquo;s marriage to Sarah Mason on the 2nd September
1802, in the Register of Stilton church.&nbsp; His children were
baptized as Catholics, and the priest specially calls Sarah Mason
his lawful wife.&nbsp; Another instance in this list, selected
haphazard by Mr. Rhodes from papers in the Record Office, shows
how in two generations a false family tradition may arise.&nbsp;
In 1894 I visited, in search of information, the daughter-in-law,
then a widow aged eighty-six, of the James Robinette whose
engagement as a permanent mason and labourer at the Depot is
recorded on page 61.&nbsp; She told me her husband&rsquo;s father
was a French prisoner, who had been made a turnkey at the
Barracks!&nbsp; On searching the church Register, 1 found that
the Robinettes had been residents in Yaxley fifty years at least
before the arrival of the prisoners at Norman Cross, and between
1748 and 1796 the records of three generations appear in the
register&mdash;James, the son of James and Catherine Robinette,
born in 1780, was doubtless the man appointed in 1813 to the job
at the Barracks.</p>
<p>The Robinettes were probably some of the many French Huguenots
who came over after the repeal, on the 15th October 1685, of the
Edict of Nantes, and settled in the neighbourhood of Peterborough
to further reclaim and cultivate the lately drained fens.&nbsp;
The fallacy of coming to conclusions, founded on names only
without other evidence, is illustrated by the following sentence
in a series of papers on Norman Cross published in the
<i>Peterborough Advertiser</i> by the late Rev. G. N. Godwin:
&ldquo;At Stilton the names of Habarte, of Drage, and of Tesloff,
and near Thorney the name of Egar, and at Peterborough, among
others, the name of Vergette, still speak of the old war
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of these names, Habarte alone is that of
descendants of a French prisoner, the majority of those bearing
the others are of the old Huguenot stock, while the Vergettes,
who formerly believed themselves to be descendants of an ancestor
of this same stock, now know that they were an old-established
English family in 1555, when their ancestor, Robert Vergette, was
Sheriff of Lincoln.</p>

year 1800 it is stated that the price of wheat was only kept down
to &pound;5 a quarter by the system of bounties on imported
wheat, the same applying to the prices of other grain.&nbsp; The
present proprietor of &ldquo;The Oundle Brewery&rdquo; kindly
extracted from the Books of the Firm particulars as to the beer
supplied to the Regiments quartered at Norman Cross in the year
1799.&nbsp; The total amount was 4,449 barrels of 36 gallons
each.&nbsp; This gentleman adds, the beer could not be very good,
the price being about 6<i>d.</i> a gallon.&nbsp; His father said
that <i>he</i> had often been told by <i>his</i> father, that the
great expansion of the business was due to the contract with the
Barracks.&nbsp; Buckles Brewery, a Peterborough business, also
flourished on a large contract to supply the prisoners with
&ldquo;Small Beer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. George Gaunt, who was
formerly in a large business as a butcher, informed me that,
taking the figures which I gave him as a basis, and the average
weight of a bullock at about 850 lb., he considered that from
five to six would be required every day, if beef alone and no
other meat were supplied.&nbsp; These figures give some idea of
the advantages derived by the neighbouring traders from this
great Government Establishment.</p>
<p>The following extract from a letter addressed to me by Mr.
Samuel Booth shows how many people in one family group alone
found employment in connection with the Depot:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I send you a few particulars about my
relatives, which may, or may not, be useful to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My great-grandmother, Mrs. Allen, who lies in the old
graveyard, used to carry green-grocery to sell to the
prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s father was Pay-Sergeant at the
Barracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather, Samuel Briggs, of Ailsworth, was
constable; he was also in the Militia, and was told off to keep
guard on Thorpe Road, at the entrance to Peterboro&rsquo;, on the
escape of some prisoners, but who went the way to Ramsay.&nbsp; I
have a box made by the prisoners, presented to my grandfather,
who was also a carpenter, and at times went to work there.&nbsp;
The prisoners used to beg pieces of wood and other materials of
him.&nbsp; He used to speak of their cleverness in the making of
fancy articles, and of their endeavours to escape&mdash;one got
in the manure cart, and got away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We the undersigned do voluntarily certify upon Oath that the
number of Sick in the Hospital under our care at Norman Cross, on
the 19th November last, was 194, including 24 nurses; that the
daily number from the 7th August was always less; and that at no
one period since the commencement of the establishment did the
actual number exceed 260.&nbsp; That the prisons are
systematically visited and searched every morning by the surgeon

<p>The 24 men were employed as nurses.&nbsp; Whenever the
prisoners are sent to the Hospital, they are admitted, whether
their disorders are slight or violent, and while there, they are
treated with humanity and attention, and provided with everything
necessary for the re-establishment of their health.&nbsp; No
epidemic or contagious distemper.</p>

Trafalgar on 21st October 1805, the <i>Leviathan</i>,
seventy-four guns, under Captain Bayton, was next to the
<i>Victory</i>.&nbsp; After passing through the enemy&rsquo;s
line she dismasted her opponent, raked the <i>Santissima
Trinidad</i>, and passed on to the <i>San Augustin</i>, one of
seven coming to surround her; this ship was silenced in fifteen
minutes, and the crew of the <i>Leviathan</i>, making her fast
with a hawser, towed her into the English Fleet with the English
Jack flying.&nbsp; The French ship
<i>L&rsquo;Intr&eacute;pide</i> had by distant firing cut into
the sails and rigging of the <i>Leviathan</i>, but three more
British ships coming up, <i>L&rsquo;Intr&eacute;pide</i> was,
after a noble resistance, also compelled to surrender, and was
set on fire by the <i>Britannia</i>.&nbsp; The crews were landed
at Portsmouth and transferred to Norman Cross, where they were
received on 8th January 1806.&nbsp; One was Corporal Jean De la
Porte, whose name appears as the maker of signed straw marquetry
pictures, and to whom are attributed many other unsigned pictures
of the same character.&nbsp; Mr. Jean De la Porte is spoken of as
an officer; had he been of that rank he would not have been in
the prison, but out on parole.&nbsp; He was a Petty Officer, and
would be in the Petty Officers&rsquo; prison.&nbsp; He was
confined at Norman Cross for nearly nine years, and during this
long captivity his artistic skill and taste must have enormously
mitigated his suffering.</p>

who were sent from Falmouth to Norman Cross.</p>

Bede), who half a century ago was the incumbent of Denton, a
village a little over a mile from Norman Cross, left the
following note among the MSS. which were prepared for a history
of Huntingdon, or, as he called it, <i>Cromwell&rsquo;s
County</i>, which was never completed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The French prisoners at the prison made
beautiful straw plaits, which were purchased by people in Stilton
and sold at a high rate.&nbsp; For a long time they were
forbidden to sell these plaits, but they found means to do so
through the soldiers.&nbsp; No doubt the soldiers made a great
deal of money in this way, although the plaits were sold so
cheaply that many people in Stilton made very respectable
fortunes by their sale.&nbsp; The soldiers secretly brought the
straw plaits to the houses, sometimes wrapped round their bodies
under their clothes; in this case they would go upstairs and
undress, and then come down with the straw plaits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know how the prisoners got the straw, but as
they could no more make straw plaits without straw than the
Israelites could make bricks, I suppose the soldiers helped them
to it.&nbsp; Much of the plait (which was more neatly made than
the English manufacture) was made up and sold in Stilton.&nbsp;
Other was hawked about round the district; also sent to wholesale
houses in London or elsewhere.&nbsp; One vendor of the straw
plaits cleared a thousand pounds in a few years.&rdquo;</p>

few of the Danes were brought to Norman Cross, either in the
first period of the war, or in the second period in which this
return was made.</p>

class="footnote">[208]</a>&nbsp; Of the after history of the
young men and maidens who contracted these romantic marriages I
can give information in only two cases.&nbsp; Charles Peter
Vanderaa, entered in the register of the Record Office as
lieutenant on a brig-of-war, was married on the day of his
release.&nbsp; Whether he took his wife to Holland or not, his
grandson, from whom I got my information, did not know.&nbsp; All
he knew was that his grandfather, in some capacity or other,
again took to the sea, and that he died of yellow fever in Spain
or one of the Spanish colonies, leaving his widow with two sons,
Thomas and Peter.&nbsp; The widow, after his death, lived in
Peterborough in very poor circumstances.&nbsp; The second son,
Peter, I well remember earning a living as a schoolmaster in
Peterborough, where he had at one time been in the police force;
he married and had one daughter, who married a blacksmith named
Dawson.&nbsp; The couple moved to London, where there may be a
colony of the cadet&rsquo;s descendants, recking nothing of their
Dutch blood.&nbsp; The oldest son, Thomas Vanderaa, had two sons,
one of whom I knew well.&nbsp; His mental capacity was not very
high; he got his living as a casual, respectable gardener and
handy man.&nbsp; He died a few years since, but I have preserved
the letter in which he gave me the information about his
relatives.</p>
<p>When in 1894 Mr. Vanderaa gave me the information about his
family, he said he had a brother, who was, he believed, alive,
but he did not know where he was living.</p>
<p>Of the descendants of the Miss Roelans, who married Mr. Joseph
Little, several are living in a good social position; but the
Dutch blood does not seem to have passed into the collateral
branches of Moores, Buckles, and other well-known families who
have intermarried with the Littles.</p>
<p><a name="footnote210a"></a><a href="#citation210a"
class="footnote">[210a]</a>&nbsp; The gunsmith&rsquo;s business
was a good one, and remained in the family, and the grandson, M.
Hubert Habart, who had succeeded to it, had an exhibit of guns in
the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park in
1851.</p>
<p><a name="footnote210b"></a><a href="#citation210b"
class="footnote">[210b]</a>&nbsp; Several of M. Habart&rsquo;s
descendants are still alive.&nbsp; One of his granddaughters,
Miss Habart, is my consulting-room attendant.&nbsp; The family of
the Rev. Father Robert A. Davis, from whose copy of
Macgregor&rsquo;s plan the plate on p. 18 is taken, is connected
by marriage with that of the Habarts.&mdash;T. J. W.</p>

authorities summed up the failure of the negotiations for
exchange: &ldquo;There is no fixing the French Government to any
basis of exchange.&nbsp; Every concession on our part has
produced fresh demands.&nbsp; We have about 50,000 prisoners of
war in England, in France there are about 12,000, two-thirds of
whom are not prisoners, but <i>d&eacute;tenus</i>, many of them
women and children.&nbsp; Even these our Government were willing
to exchange, when the French Government proposed that their
50,000 should be sent over <i>en masse</i>, for the 12,000, and
then afterwards the Spaniards would be released.&nbsp; This would
enable it to man twenty-five sail of the line, and still retain
the Spaniards, our allies, in his hands.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Naval

Norman Cross, either at this period of the war or in the second
period when there were a considerable number confined in Great
Britain.&nbsp; From a return made to the House of Commons in
1812, it appears that of 54,508 prisoners confined at the various
depots, 52,640 were French and 1,868 Danes, but no register of
Danish prisoners confined at Norman Cross has been found.</p>

class="footnote">[241]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Share often heard his
grandmother speak of her husband&rsquo;s acts of kindness to the
prisoners who were landed at Plymouth.&nbsp; One incident which
he recollects was, that one day, just as the family were sitting
down to dinner, Captain Holditch ran in, seized the large
beefsteak pie just placed on the table, and carried it off,
saying, &ldquo;I want this, there are a batch of French prisoners
going by, and they look famished, they must have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin (<i>loc. cit.</i>), mentioning that on Christmas
Day 1805 some 250 French prisoners from Porchester Castle marched
into Basingstoke on their cheerless way to Norman Cross (probably
some of the heroes who had fought against Nelson and his captains
on the 21st October), asks the question, &ldquo;Did the Hampshire
folk give them a share in their festivities?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
above anecdote justifies us, I hope, in saying that the answer to
this question would be &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

source of profit to the farmers, who had contracted to remove
them regularly from their positions below the latrines, and had
used their contents, with the rest of the refuse of the prison,
as a guano to the great benefit of their land.</p>

was to be served out to any prisoner, though most were captured
with none beyond what they stood upright in.&nbsp; No soup was to
be served out, except to the prisoners who acted as
barbers.&nbsp; He asked for some modification of this, but was
refused.&nbsp; He was allowed &pound;25 per annum for coals and
candles, and 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each time he went to
Peterborough on the Board&rsquo;s Order or to make affidavits as

the other existing prisons were greatly overcrowded, but
Wellington found it impossible to guard and maintain his
prisoners on the Continent.&nbsp; Not only were the troops
actually captured overwhelmingly numerous, but to their number
were added deserters.&nbsp; In one of his dispatches, he writes:
&ldquo;Two battalions of the Regiment of Nassau, and one of
Frankfort having quitted the enemies&rsquo; Army and passed over
to that under my command. . . .&nbsp; I now send these troops to
England.&rdquo;&nbsp; The long-delayed completion of the prisons
at Dartmoor and Perth would relieve the overcrowding of Norman
Cross; but the resources of the staff must, in the meantime, have
been strained to an extreme point to prevent the evils which
might result from the state of matters.&nbsp; The breakdown of
the various negotiations for exchange prevented the relief which
was afforded during the first period of the war by the steady
drain of prisoners sent back to their own country.</p>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
